Moon dumps top two economic bigwigs,2018-11-10 12:00,National,LEE SUNG-EUN,"From left: Hong Nam-ki, Kim Soo-hyun Kim Dong-yeon, finance minister and deputy prime minister for economic affairs, openly locked horns with Jang Ha-sung, presidential chief of staff for policy, on how to save Korea’s slumping economy. Jang crafted Moon’s trademark income-led growth policy and insisted on keeping it even as thousands of jobs vanished, while Kim wanted changes. By replacing Kim and Jang, the Blue House said that the administration’s double-tier leadership system for national economic policy planning would become a single-tier system, with authority given to the finance minister. Hong Nam-ki, currently chief of the Office for Government Policy Coordination under the Prime Minister’s Office, was named finance minister and deputy prime minister for economic affairs. Yoon Young-chan, presidential secretary for public affairs, said at a press conference Friday that Hong was the perfect fit for finance minister at a time when the country needs “innovative and drastic policy implementation,” adding the Blue House looked forward to seeing him pursue economic policies focused on “income-led growth and fair economy,” creating an “embracing country.”Kim Soo-hyun, senior presidential secretary for social affairs, was named Jang’s successor as presidential chief of staff for policy. Born in Yeongdeok County, North Gyeongsang, Kim earned his bachelor’s and master’s degree in urban planning and engineering at Seoul National University, after which he earned a Ph.D. in environmental studies from the same school. Kim Soo-hyun served as presidential secretary for social affairs and adviser on economic policy during the Roh Moo-hyun administration, during which he also worked as vice environment minister.Kim Yeon-myung, a professor of social welfare studies at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, will succeed Kim Soo-hyun as senior presidential secretary for social affairs.Rep. Yoon Young-seok, chief spokesman for the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, said tapping Kim Soo-hyun as the new presidential chief of staff for policy was a “declaration of war” by the Moon Blue House to continue to pursue its failed income-led growth policy because Kim Soo-hyun helped draft it. Yoon also took issue with Kim Soo-hyun's academic background, saying he studied urban planning and engineering in school and wasn’t an economics expert. Finance minister nominee Hong will go through a parliamentary hearing, though an approval from the National Assembly is not required.BY LEE SUNG-EUN [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]"
"To combat fine dust, gov’t focuses on diesel cars",2018-11-10 12:00,Business,KIM EUN-JIN,"There were 32 fine dust advisories issued between Nov. 3 and 6 across the country. Advisories are issued when the concentration of fine dust particles exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic meter. “Various factors contribute to fine dust, including domestic factors like power generation, industry, transportation and construction,” Lee said. “Emissions from neighboring countries contribute as well. I hope the Ministry of Environment and other relevant agencies can introduce strengthened measures to reduce fine dust and bring about noticeable changes.”Though diesel cars were encouraged when first introduced to Korea in the early 2000s because they were believed to produce less air pollution than gasoline vehicles, the government now wants to encourage zero-emission vehicles that run on sustainable energy sources like electricity and hydrogen instead. A recent Ministry of Environment study found that diesel cars were responsible for 92 percent of all fine dust created by vehicles. The government also said that, starting in February, it will enforce the so-called odd-even license plate policy for all cars on days with high fine dust levels. Other measures include raising fuel taxes on coal and continuing to shut down coal-powered thermal power plants from March to June. Concentrations of atmosphere particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers in South Chungcheong decreased by 24.1 percent this March to June compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2016 on average according to the Ministry of Environment. The two countries established a center for environmental cooperation in June to conduct joint research on fine dust. The government also vowed to work with other neighboring countries including North Korea for cleaner air on the peninsula. BY KIM EUN-JIN [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]"
Pyongyang fumes over initiative,2018-11-10 12:00,National,LEE SUNG-EUN,"The Korean-language news article published on Uriminzokkiri accused the U.S. of trying to sabotage efforts between both Koreas to achieve peace and prosperity, adding that the United States doesn’t have any “justification” to interfere in South-North relations.The North urged South Korea to distance itself from the United States and focus on carrying out joint declarations signed by the leaders of both countries this year, stressing that South-North relations “cannot improve a bit” if Seoul continues to be “fooled” by Washington.A senior South Korean Foreign Ministry official later said the group would start operating sometime this month and denied speculation it was created by Washington to pressure Seoul to slow down inter-Korean cooperation. The source said Seoul proposed creating the working group first and that both sides were in talks on the subject for several months.The State Department initially announced the meeting on Tuesday before saying it was canceled Wednesday with no explanation. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Thursday in New York that it was North Korea who canceled the meeting, apparently “because they weren’t ready.”“I do think the talks are going to be rescheduled,” Haley said of the Pompeo-Kim Yong-chol meeting. “It doesn’t change the fact that the summit is still scheduled for the president and Kim [Jong-un] to meet after the first of the year.”“The threat is still there,” she said. “North Korea still has nuclear facilities and they’ve still not allowed inspectors in to inspect them.”Seoul’s Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon will travel to Washington next week to meet with officials from the U.S. government and Congress to discuss inter-Korean relations and the establishment of peace on the Korean Peninsula, the ministry said Friday.BY LEE SUNG-EUN [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]"

Younger Team Kim takes aim at curling crown,2018-11-10 12:00,Sports,null,"The Korean women’s curling team competes in a round robin game against Japan at the 2018 Pacific-Asia Curling Championship at Gangneung Curling Centre in Gangwon. [YONHAP]Team Kim, the Korean women’s curling team that won silver at the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and stole the hearts of a nation, no longer represents the country. The new Team Kim is composed of skip Kim Min-ji, lead Kim Su-jin, second Yang Tae-i and vice-skip Kim Hye-rin. They are currently competing at the 2018 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships (PACC) in Gangneung.In the finals, scheduled for tomorrow at 2 p.m., Korea will play against Japan, who defeated Hong Kong on Friday. Although the women’s curling team is continuing their success at the PyeongChang Olympics, it isn’t the same team. The team currently competing at the PACC defeated the old Team Kim 10-3 during the 2018-19 national team qualifiers in August. “When I was in seventh grade at Minrak Middle School at Uijeongbu [in Gyeonggi], I was interested in track,” Kim Min-ji said. “But at the time, [Kim] Hye-rin, who was my classmate, was playing curling. It looked fun so I started playing with her and ended up playing the sport. Then, [Kim] Su-jin, joined us in the eighth grade when she joined our school after moving from Incheon. All three of us went to Songhyun High School, and in 10th grade, [Yang] Tae-i completed our team.”After their successful junior career right after high school, they continued the sport as professionals, joining the Chuncheon, Gangwon, team. Over the past three seasons, the Chuncheon Team Kim always competed against the North Gyeongsang Team Kim in the national team qualifiers, but they always came up just short. This year, the North Gyeongsang team once again seemed as if they were going to represent the national team for another year, as it swept all of its games in round robin. However, it missed their spot by losing the final game to the Chuncheon team. After finally earning the national team spot, the Chuncheon team made their debut at the first leg of the Curling World Cup in Suzhou, China. The team had a disappointing debut, finishing last in Group B with one win and five losses against the world’s top teams. The team’s coach, Lee Sung-jun, agreed that the team needs to improve, but they are still young. Lee’s been coaching the team for seven years.As curling in Korea became more familiar to the fans after the PyeongChang Olympics, the young Team Kim is hoping to continue to build on its success. To do so, the team believes that they need to see better results in international tournaments. Korea will compete for gold against Japan at 2 p.m. today at Gangneung Curling Centre in Gangwon."

The problem with good will,2018-11-10 12:00,영어신문학습,null,"Bae Myung-bok, a senior columnist of the JoongAng Ilbo Moon made it clear that the country cannot go back to the days of deepening economic inequality even if his new approach does not bear fruits immediately. Despite some problems in the course of shifting policy direction, he vowed to maintain a policy to live well together. He urged the public to trust the government and wait until a budget of 470.5 trillion won ($418.6 billion) that would bring tangible achievements from his economic policy. No policy is perfect. We must change direction if a policy is not going well. Before deciding to stick with its income-led growth policy, the administration must check whether its financial support for the low income class is properly allocated. Before discussing innovative growth, companies also need a morale boost. Who wants to work if businessmen are treated like criminals? To talk about a fair economy, the government should be strict with itself. The deputy prime minister for the economy or the presidential policy chief should be given full authority to correct inefficiencies and abnormalities. The Moon administration called the Park Geun-hye administration a “Blue House government,” but it is starting to resemble the Park government. The Blue House reigns above the party and government. Many of Moon’s aides at the Blue House are driven by ideas but lack competence or experience. The first year of the administration may have passed with high hopes, but the second year is when problems arise.  지난주 국회 시정연설에서 문재인 대통령이 던진 화두는 ‘함께 잘 사는 사회’였다. 잘 사는 자식보다 못 사는 자식을 먼저 생각하는 부모의 심정으로 더불어 잘 사는 공동체를 이루고자 하는 그의 선의를 의심하는 사람은 별로 없을 것이다. 그는 “지난 1년6개월은 함께 잘 살기 위해 우리 경제와 사회구조를 근본적으로 바꾸고자 노력했던 시간이었다”며 “이를 위해 (J노믹스의 세 축인) 소득주도 성장, 혁신성장, 공정경제를 추진했다”고 회고했다. J노믹스의 중심축인 소득주도 성장은 저소득층의 실질소득을 늘려주면 소비가 늘어나고, 소비 증대는 기업의 생산과 투자 증대 및 일자리 창출로 이어져 경제성장이 촉진된다는 가정에 근거하고 있다. 저소득층의 실질소득 증대를 위해 문재인 정부는 최저임금을 대폭 인상하고 각종 지원책을 통해 막대한 돈을 풀었다. 하지만 아직 효과는 나타나지 않고 있다. 최저임금 인상으로 일자리를 잃은 사람들과 문을 닫는 자영업자와 영세 상공업자가 속출하고 있을 뿐이다. 빌 클린턴 전 미국 대통령의 선거 구호였던 ‘바보야, 문제는 경제야’라는 말이 요즘처럼 피부에 와 닿은 적도 드물다. 대북정책에서 점수를 따도 경제가 죽을 쑤면 별무소용이다. 한국갤럽 여론조사에서 문 대통령의 국정 수행에 대한 지지율은 지난주 55%로 떨어졌다. 평양 방문의 반짝 효과가 사라지면서 3주 새 10%포인트가 빠졌다. 김동연 경제부총리와 장하성 청와대 정책실장 동시 교체 카드는 분위기 쇄신을 통해 지지율 반등을 꾀하려는 의도로 읽힌다. 일점일획 바꿀 수 없는 지고지선(至高至善)한 정책은 세상에 없다. 가다 아니면 멈춰야 한다. 소득주도 성장을 더 밀어붙이기 전에 저소득층을 위한 재정 지원이 제대로 가고 있는지부터 따져야 한다. 중간에 새는 게 너무 많다. 혁신성장을 논하기 전에 기업들의 기부터 살려줘야 한다. 기업인 모두를 범죄자 취급하는 분위기에서 누가 일할 마음이 날까. 공정경제를 말하려면 칼자루를 쥔 정부부터 자신에게 엄정해야 한다. 비효율과 비정상을 바로잡는 일에 관한 한 전권을 주고, 경제부총리든 정책실장이든 모셔와야 한다. 박근혜 정부를 ‘청와대 정부’라고 욕했던 문재인 정부 스스로 박근혜 정부를 닮아가고 있다. 청와대가 국정을 틀어쥐고 당과 정부 위에 군림하고 있다. 지금 청와대에 있는 참모들 대다수가 이념만 있지 실력과 경험이 부족하다. 그럴수록 쓸데없는 아집에 사로잡히기 쉽다. 집권 1년 차까지는 감동적인 수사(修辭)와 현란한 쇼로 넘어갈 수 있지만, 곳곳에서 문제가 터지는 집권 2년 차부터는 다르다. 실력이 고스란히 드러난다."
