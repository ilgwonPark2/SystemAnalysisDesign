Organized by the Gangwon Film Commission in coordination with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korean Film Council, the festival is part of a project to commemorate 100 years of Korean filmmaking.

South and North to each preserve 1 of 11 GPs scheduled for probational dismantlement,2018-11-09 18:10,North Korea,Yoo Kang-moon,"South and North Korea have agreed to each preserve one of the 11 guard posts in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) they had agreed to completely dismantle by the end of this month. South Korea has selected a guard post along the East Sea and North Korea a guard post in the central area.

“During the 10th general-level military talks and correspondence, the South and North Korean militaries shared the sense that some guard posts are worthy of preservation and agreed to each preserve one of the 11 guard posts that are supposed to be dismantled on a trial basis,” South Korea’s Ministry of Defense announced on Nov. 8.

According to the Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA), signed on Sept. 19, the two sides are supposed to remove firearms, equipment and troops from eleven guard posts in the DMZ on a trial basis and then completely dismantle the facilities by the end of this month.

South Korea selected a surveillance guard post on the East Sea in light of its historical significance and preservation value and the possibility of its peaceful use in the future. This guard post is the closest to the East Sea and was the first built after the armistice agreement was reached in 1953.

“This guard post is regarded as having historical preservation value; a very great potential for peaceful applications because of its links to Mt. Kumgang, the East Sea coastline and Kamho Lake; and considerable accessibility because of its proximity to the inter-Korean highway along the East Sea,” the Defense Ministry explained.

The North Koreans also selected a guard post in the central region according to their own criteria.

Since the South and North Korean militaries have agreed to preserve the guard posts in question intact without completely destroying their facilities, they have agreed to continually verify that these facilities are not being used for military purposes.

“The South and North Korean militaries are exploring ways to increase mutual trust and transparency during the probationary dismantlement of guard posts. We’re planning to make every effort to ensure that the probationary withdrawal is complete by the end of December,” the Defense Ministry said.

“We intend to complete the removal of troops and firearms by Nov. 10 and to also work on dismantling several of the guard posts. Our plan is to dismantle the guard posts using excavators rather than explosives in light of safety and environmental concerns,” a Ministry official said.



On Nov. 8, prior to the two sides’ agreement, a civic group held a press conference asking for the dismantlement of the observation guard posts to be postponed and for the two sides to deliberate ways to preserve them. This group was organized to advocate converting the guard posts from outposts of war and confrontation into places for learning about peace and life.

“During the process of unification, Germany completely dismantled the Berlin Wall, but now that more than twenty years have passed, a project is underway to restore this as a historical site. Sites that do not impose major stress on the natural ecosystem ought to be preserved as civic spaces, as places for learning the lessons of war and for feeling the preciousness of life and peace,” the group said in a joint statement.

This statement was signed by 18 civic groups, including the Conflict Resolution and Peace Center, Green Korea, and Korea DMZ Peace-Life Valley; Rep. Ha Tae-gyeong, a lawmaker with the Bareunmirae Party; Rep. Lee Won-uk and Rep. Lee Won-uk, lawmakers with the Democratic Party; and Rep. Shim Jae-cheol, lawmaker with the Liberty Korea Party.

[News analysis] Trump reconfirms plan to have 2nd summit with Kim Jong-un early next year,2018-11-09 18:08,North Korea,Noh Ji-won,"US President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Nov. 7 that he plans to have a second bilateral summit early next year with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He also announced plans to reschedule high-level North Korea-US talks that had been announced for Nov. 8 before being abruptly postponed a day beforehand. With the midterm elections no longer restricting his range of options as president, Trump appears to be reaffirming his commitment to keeping the momentum going in North Korea-US dialogue.

When asked about the schedule for the second summit with Kim during a press conference at the White House the day after the midterm elections, Trump replied, “Sometime early next year.”

“We’re going to change it [the meeting schedule] because of trips that are being made. We’re going to make it at another date,” he explained about the postponed high-level meeting in New York.

“That meeting is going to be rescheduled,” he said later.

Trump also repeatedly stressed that the US was “in no rush” in its negotiations with Pyongyang and that “the sanctions are on.”

“Now, I’d love to take the sanctions off. But they [North Korea] have to be responsive, too. It’s a two-way street,” he said in a message calling on Pyongyang to take action. Indeed, Trump repeated the words “the sanctions are on” four times and “no rush” seven times, in what could be read as a kind of pressure campaign against North Korea.



The postponement of the high-level talks was also confirmed to have been requested by Pyongyang. During a plenary session of the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee on Nov. 8, Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Kyung-wha said Washington had “explained to us that it had received a notification from the North asking for the postponement.”

“The US told us that there has been an explanation from the North that they wanted a postponement because their mutual schedules were so busy,” Kang explained.

North Korea reportedly pushed strongly for a meeting between Workers’ Party of Korea Vice Chairman Kim Yong-chol and Trump to resolve the sanctions issue, eventually postponing the talks after no date could be set for the meeting due to Trump’s planned visit to Europe on Nov. 9. Analysts also interpreted the postponement as Pyongyang sending the message that the North Koreans are “not pushovers.”

The question of when the high-level North Korea-US talks are rescheduled now looks set to be a major signal for the negotiations’ prospects. Administration officials and experts predicted the talks would be resumed within the year.

“President Trump said they’d be holding a North Korea-US summit early next year, and the North Korea-US summit is one of the agenda items at the high-level talks,” noted a senior South Korean government official familiar with the situation in North Korea-US relations, who concluded that the likelihood of the talks happening within 2019 is strong.

“The fact that the US said that much should be taken as meaning there has been some considerable progress in behind-the-scenes dialogue with North Korea,” the official added.

But with a large gap to bridge between North Korea’s demands for immediate loosening of sanctions and the US’ insistence on denuclearization before sanctions are lifted – along with growing internal frustration in North Korea over sanctions impeding progress in economic development – some observers worry the momentum could end up drained if the talks keep getting postponed over the two sides’ failure to meet in the middle. Others have suggested the possibility of reaching a compromise is being undercut by the US’ failure to state a clear standard for the kind of denuclearization progress needed from North Korea before it will loosen sanctions.



Delays in the high-level North Korea-US talks also affect the implementation of agreements between South and North Korea. Matters such as a joint survey of the Gyeongui (Seoul-Sinuiju) railway line and full-scale repairs and renovation of the reunion site for divided families are tied to the sanctions currently imposed on North Korea. Administration officials have said that while the sanctions have some effect, the situation does not bar them from implementing the terms of the inter-Korean agreements.

But with the US insisting that inter-Korean relations should not “get ahead of things” before North Korea and the US agree on a concrete denuclearization process through their high-level talks, some are suggesting it will become more difficult to implement the inter-Korean agreements.

“Inter-Korean cooperation is definitely constrained when the US isn’t cooperating,” said Professor Kim Joon-hyung of Handong Global University.

“It’s a difficult situation where we ultimately have to decide how the government is going to achieve progress, and whether South Korea can play a leading role through things like a reciprocal visit by Kim Jong-un,” he added.

[Correspondent’s column] China forfeited its status as a state belligerent in Korean War,2018-11-09 18:04,North Korea,Kim Oi-hyun,"On Oct. 8, 1950, a document handwritten by Mao Zedong was sent to the leaders of China’s military, including Peng Dehuai, Gao Gang and Hong Xuezhi, ordering them to send troops to the Korean War. An early draft of this document contains numerous traces of revision. One interesting change was in the name of the army that was sent to Korea, called the People’s Volunteer Army (PVA).

Mao originally wrote “支援軍,” meaning “supportive army,” but replaced that with “志願軍,” meaning “volunteer army. The two words are homonyms, with the basic pronunciation of “zhiyuanjun,” though the tones are different. Considering that this correction was made in four of the six places where the word “volunteer army” appears, it doesn’t appear to have been merely an accident.

This document was featured in an exhibition in Beijing on June 2011, on the 90th anniversary of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Chinese newspapers that covered the story of the exhibition reported on the reason the name had been changed. Mao and the Communist Party had originally wanted the name of the army to reflect the fact that China was helping North Korea on a governmental level, but the name was changed after Huang Yanpei, one of China’s founding fathers and a member of the China Democratic League (rather than the Communist Party), argued that this was inappropriate. Hwang suggested that the army should have a non-governmental quality since the US might declare war on China if China supported North Korea with its regular army.

In light of this background, finding the homonym “志願” was a stroke of genius. There is a rival theory that the troops were voluntary to begin with and that the name was never changed, but the idea that Huang suggested the name change is widespread in China. Whatever the case, even though China’s supreme leader Mao Zedong appointed Peng Dehuai as commander and ordered him to swiftly reorganize the regular troops on the northeastern border into the “People’s Volunteer Army” and send them into battle, China effectively claimed that people were going to war on a voluntary and individual basis rather than on the orders of the state.

China also claimed that the PVA was not a state army during the debate about withdrawing foreign militaries that was repeatedly brought up during the negotiations about ending the Korean War. If the UN forces withdrew, the Chinese said, they would do their best to persuade the PVA to go home, too. Peng Dehuai even signed the armistice agreement on July 27, 1953, as “commander of the People’s Volunteer Army.” When the PVA withdrew from North Korea in 1958, they were absorbed into the Chinese regular army. Though there was a continuing debate about how these soldiers were treated, there were no more actions taken under the name of the PVA command. That was because, at least officially, this volunteer organization had dispersed.

While announcing its intention to take part in building a peace system on the Korean Peninsula, China has brought up its status as a signatory to the armistice agreement. But if we take the PVA’s identity seriously, China explicitly forfeited its status as a belligerent from the very beginning of the war. For China to now claim that the state participated in the war could raise the controversy about “interfering in domestic affairs” that it had initially feared. This also contradicts the position that China frequently emphasizes these days about never interfering in other country’s domestic affairs.

China’s concerns are also evident in the Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty, which was concluded in 1961. The second clause of the treaty promises automatic engagement if either side is invaded, which certainly sounds like a military alliance. But China later adopted the position that it had forged a partnership, not an alliance, and has criticized the US’ alliances with South Korea and Japan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as relics of the Cold War. China no longer speaks openly about its alliance with North Korea, and it would be awkward to do so.

Though China’s status as a party to the Korean War and its alliance with North Korea are key issues related to the end-of-war declaration and the conversion to a peace regime, China’s unclear position has become an obstacle in various respects. But this is also a topic that China is unlikely to bring up on its own. Perhaps it would be best for South Korea to officially recognize China’s status as a party to the armistice, the end-of-war declaration and the peace regime while simultaneously emphasizing that the China-North Korea alliance provides balance to the South Korea-US alliance.

[Photo] Kremlin hopes for Kim Jong-un to visit Russia in 2019,2018-11-09 17:59,North Korea,,"The Kremlin has announced that it hopes for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to visit Russia next year. Reuters reported on Nov. 7 that Kremlin aid Yuri Ushakov said, “I hope this visit will be possible next year.” In May, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to Pyongyang to invite Kim to the Easter Economic Forum, which was held in Vladivostok on Sept. 11-13, but Kim did not attend the event."
Trump confirms 2nd summit with Kim Jong-un in early 2019,2018-11-08 17:40,North Korea,Hwang Joon-bum,"On Nov. 7, US President Donald Trump reconfirmed that he would be holding another summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the beginning of 2019. Trump also said that the high-level talks between US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korean Kim Yong-chol, vice chairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) and director of the WPK United Front Department, which had been abruptly canceled one day before they were supposed to take place on Nov. 8, would be rescheduled.

When Trump was asked by a reporter during a press conference at the White House the day after the midterm elections on Nov. 6 about the timing of his second summit with Kim, Trump said, “sometime early next year.” 

In regard to the plan for the high-level North Korea-US talks in New York scheduled for Nov. 8, whose cancelation had been announced by the US State Department on midnight, Trump said, “We’re going to change [the schedule of the high-level talks] because of trips that are being made. We’re going to make it at another date.” Trump went on to say that “that meeting is going to be rescheduled.”

At midnight on Nov. 7, the US State Department announced that the high-level talks scheduled for Nov. 8 “will now take place at a later date. We will reconvene when our respective schedules permit.” 

According to one source, North Korea had pushed hard for Kim Yong-chol to have a meeting with Trump in order to reach a solution on the sanctions issue. When the North still found itself without a definite answer from the US on Nov. 7, the source said, it finally asked for the meeting to be delayed. Trump is reportedly planning to depart for France on Nov. 9 to attend an event on Nov. 11 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.

Trump’s statement that he will reschedule the high-level talks with the North Koreans and hold a second summit with Kim at the beginning of next year is being taken as confirmation that he hopes to preserve momentum in North Korea-US talks.



When US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Robert Palladino was asked during the regular briefing on Nov. 7 why the delay of the high-level North Korea-US talks was announced in the middle of the night, he said, “as soon as the information that we had was confirmed, we decided to release it as early as possible.” 

Palladino also fielded a question about why the meeting was delayed. “Schedules change all the time,” he said. “We’re dealing with purely a scheduling issue.” Palladino added that the US is “in a pretty good place” with North Korea.

During his press conference, Trump once again emphasized that there’s “no rush” on the North Korea issue because “the sanctions are on.”

“The sanctions are on. The missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home. The great heroes [remains of American soldiers] have been coming home,” Trump said. “But I’m in no rush.”

“Now, I’d love to take the sanctions off. But they have to be responsive, too. It’s a two-way street,” Trump said. He repeated the phrase “the sanctions are on” seven times and the phrase “no rush” four times in the press conference.

N. Korea-US high-level talks postponed just a day after State Department announced them,2018-11-08 17:28,North Korea,Noh Ji-won,"High-level talks scheduled to take place on Nov. 8 between US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korean Workers’ Party Vice Chairman Kim Yong-chol were abruptly postponed on Nov. 7. Observers are speculating on the reasons for the meeting’s sudden postponement just a day after its official announcement by the US State Department.

In a Nov. 8 statement, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said, “Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo’s meeting with officials from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, scheduled for this week in New York, will now take place at a later date.”

“We [the US and North Korea] will reconvene when our respective schedules permit. Ongoing conversations continue to take place,” the statement continued.

While US and North Korean authorities did not disclose the reasons for the talks’ postponement, experts said the chief reason was the two sides’ failure to reach a compromise on the matters of sanctions. While Washington continues adhering to the position that denuclearization must occur before sanctions are lifted, Pyongyang has recently become vocal in its disgruntlement with the sanctions and begun loudly demanding “simultaneous measures” with denuclearization and loosening of sanctions.



Against this backdrop, North Korea had been urgently demanding a meeting between Kim Yong-chol and US President Donald Trump to resolve the sanctions issue and finally requested the talks’ last-minute postponement after failing to receive a definite response from the US by Nov. 7, a source reported.

Kim’s delegation reportedly booked and cancelled flights from Beijing to New York multiple times on Nov. 6 and 7 as it continued waiting for an answer from the US. The move suggests Pyongyang views the US as unlikely to adopt a forward-thinking stance on loosening or lifting sanctions without a “decision” by Trump. But the US reportedly balked at the idea of a meeting, citing Trump’s scheduled visit to Europe beginning on Nov. 9.

Within North Korea, discontent is growing over the failure to produce visible economic results due to sanctions – despite the denuclearization measures that have been initiated. An example was seen in remarks attributed to leader Kim Jong-un in the Nov. 1 edition of the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, where he accused “hostile forces” of “foolishly rampaging with dastardly sanction machinations to block improvements and development in our people’s welfare.”

Institute for National Security Strategy senior research fellow Cho Sung-ryul said North Korea “may have felt there was no point in holding talks when the US is insisting it can’t relax sanctions as North Korea is demanding until denuclearization is complete.”

“Since failure to produce results even when high-level North Korean and US figures meet could sap the momentum for dialogue, they may have decided it would be better to push the date of the talks back until there has been some preliminary coordination toward producing something both sides can be happy with,” Cho suggested.

Professor at Handong Global University Kim Joon-hyung said Pyongyang “may have determined it would not yet be capable of generating results with these talks.”

“There will ultimately be talks between North Korea and the US, whether they’re high-level or working level,” Kim predicted, adding that it was “a hopeful sign that the US midterm elections are now over and President Trump has more room to maneuver.”

A Ministry of Foreign Affairs senior official noted “numerous instances in the past of North Korea-US talks being scheduled and then postponed.”

“We don’t need to get in a state every time,” the official suggested.

“The US has announced that it plans to reschedule, so the dialogue will continue,” the official added.

US State Department Special Representative for North Korea policy Stephen Biegun reportedly communicated related details to South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs Lee Do-hoon ahead of the official announcement of the talks’ postponement.

Trump’s Korea policy unlikely to change after US midterm elections,2018-11-08 17:26,North Korea,Park Min-hee,"Now that the US midterm elections have concluded with the Republicans holding the Senate and the Democrats taking the House of Representatives, what effect will this have on US President Donald Trump’s policy toward the Korean Peninsula?

The view of the majority of experts is that the outcome of this election will not have a big effect on the Trump administration’s Korean Peninsula policy. First of all, American foreign policy is set by the president and the executive branch, with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the Senate Committee on Armed Services also playing an important role. Since the Senate remains in the hands of the Republican Party, the Democratic House’s impact on foreign policy will be limited.

The fact that Trump is likely to concentrate his efforts on his reelection campaign after the “predestined defeat” in the midterm elections is itself a “green light” for negotiations on North Korea’s nuclear weapons. In the presidential election, unlike the midterms, the assessment of foreign policy plays an important role.

Since Trump pulled out of the Iranian nuclear deal, which was the signature diplomatic achievement of his predecessor, Barack Obama, and fully reimposed economic and financial sanctions on Iran, he needs to compensate by making some diplomatic achievement of his own, and his most likely option is North Korea.

“American experts and the mainstream press have attacked Trump for withdrawing from the nuclear deal even though Iran never broke it and continue to make comparisons to Trump’s negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue. This gives Trump an even greater need to get some diplomatic results in the North Korean negotiations to make up for the Iranian nuclear deal,” said Lee Hye-jeong, a professor at Chung-Ang University and an expert on American politics.

The Trump administration is likely to reschedule the postponed high-level talks with North Korea to continue the momentum for dialogue and to push for progress in the nuclear talks during the second summit with the North early next year. Trump could then cite this as a major accomplishment when he runs for reelection two years hence.



The Democratic Party, which has regained a majority in the House of Representatives after eight years, has been critical of Trump’s approach to negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue. But the Democrats are unlikely to either completely sabotage the negotiations or to switch to active support. The party has only raised doubts about Trump’s negotiating methods and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s commitment to denuclearization without offering a clear alternative in regard to denuclearization.

The most likely scenario is one in which the Democrats slow down the negotiations by requesting related documents and holding frequent hearings in the House to have government officials testify about the negotiations. But they’re likely to try to maintain balance by avoiding the appearance of outright blocking the Trump administration’s diplomatic attempts to achieve denuclearization.

In an interview with Reuters on Nov. 7, Rep. Eliot Engel, the New York Democrat who is slated to lead the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he didn’t oppose negotiations with North Korea per se: “I think it’s good to have some kind of a dialogue with them. But we shouldn’t be deluded in thinking that they’re going to have any major changes.



There are two well-known examples in American political history of US Korean Peninsula policy changing sharply after a midterm election. In 1994, the Democratic administration under President Bill Clinton reached an agreement with North Korea in Geneva that defused the first North Korean nuclear crisis, but that agreement ran into trouble when the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress in the midterm elections that year. Later, Republican President George W. Bush denounced North Korea as part of the “axis of evil,” but when his party was defeated in the midterm elections in 2006, he took a softer line on North Korea and even discussed formally ending the Korean War and signing a peace treaty with the North.

Will history repeat itself once again this time? “Even after the loss in the midterm elections, the Clinton administration moved forward with the Perry Process, which was based on engagement toward North Korea, and the Bush administration’s change in policy toward the North was affected not only by the defeat in the midterms but also by public frustration with the worsening military conditions in Iraq.

Especially considering that the Trump administration represents a very special case to which the normal rules of American politics don’t apply, it wouldn’t be right to infer from these examples that the US’ Korean Peninsula policy will change,” Lee Hye-jeong said.

Trilateral consultation group of military officers agree to draft join work rules for JSA guards,2018-11-07 17:38,North Korea,Yoo Kang-moon,"On Nov. 6, a trilateral consultation group involving military officials from South and North Korea and from the UN Command held its third meeting at Freedom House, on the South Korean side of Panmunjom, and agreed to draft joint work rules for guards before the Joint Security Area (JSA) at Panmunjom is opened up to visitors. The actual details and content of the joint work rules will be decided through correspondence.

On Tuesday, the three sides checked the new guard posts that have been built on the northern and southern entrances to the JSA. South Korea built a new guard post at the end of the “72-hour bridge” on the North Korean side, while the North Koreans built a guard post at the entrance to the South Korean side. In the future, South and North Korean guards will work together on each side.


The three parties in the consultation group furthermore assessed the operational status of surveillance equipment in the JSA and deliberated on ways to share information. Their plan is for free travel for tourists to be guaranteed as soon as the adjustment of the surveillance equipment is complete.

“We’re working to make free travel possible by the end of this month. Free travel will be in place by the end of the year at the latest,” said an official at South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense.

Kim Song-hye (in the red circle) was a member of the delegation that accompanied Kim Yo-jong, vice director of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) Central Committee, when she attended the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. The upcoming international conference will focus on measures for peace in Asia and the Pacific region."
South and North launch joint hydrographic survey of Han and Imjin estuaries,2018-11-06 17:02,North Korea,,"South and North Korea launched a hydrographic survey for the joint use of the Han and Imjin River estuaries for the first time in the 65 years since the armistice agreement was signed in 1953.

As improvements continue in inter-Korean relations, the “peace wave” has been rippling from the border regions of Gyeonggi Province and Gangwon Province all the way to Jeju Island.

The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF) and Ministry of National Defense (MND) announced the launch of a joint inter-Korean hydrographic survey on Nov. 5 for waterways in the Han River estuary to be jointly used in accordance with a Sept. 19 military agreement for implementation of the Panmunjom Declaration.

The waters subject to joint usage extend over a 70km stretch from the northeastern tip of the Gimpo Peninsula to the southwestern tip of Gyodong Island on the South Korean side, and from the village of Imhan in Kaesong’s Panmun County to the village of Haenam in Yonan County, South Hwanghae Province, on the North Korean side.

A joint survey team consisting of ten members each from the South and North Korean sides – including military and shipping authorities and hydrographic experts – will be divided the entire length into three survey zones through the end of the year. The survey involves the use of six South Korean vessels, with sonar equipment on board used to measure depths to the ocean floor and ensure safe depths for boat travel.

Once the survey is complete, the two sides plan to prove navigational information (charts) to ensure free travel by civilian vessels. Joint usage of the Han and Imjin River estuaries is expected to produce a number of different effects, as the waters are seen as suitable for the pursuit of multiple projects including aggregate extraction, tourism/recreation, and ecological preservation.

The two sides previously reached an agreement on joint use of the Han River estuary and the pursuit of aggregate extraction efforts at their Pyongyang summit in Oct. 2007, but it failed to come to fruition as inter-Korean relations subsequently soured.

“Although the armistice agreement permits free navigation by private South and North Korean vessels in the Han River estuary, actual free travel by private boats has been restricted by each side’s military authorities as ‘sensitive waters,’ so it has not been possible to conduct waterway measurements and other basic surveys or to systematically produce charts and other navigational information,” an MOF official explained.

The city of Gimpo, which has consistently pursued investigations of the Han River estuary ecosystem and waterways and free travel by private vessels in the past, recently decided to pursue full-scale exchange and cooperation between bordering South and North Korean regions following the launch of the inter-Korean Han River estuary survey.

“Gimpo City and North Korea’s Kaepung County, which share the estuary at Jogang Village between South and North, have decided to establish a sisterhood relationship and pursue various cooperation efforts,” explained Gimpo Mayor Jung Ha-young.

“The main effort will involve establishing a ‘unified special economic district’ spanning Jogang Village on the South and North Korean sides and building a ‘Jogang Peace Bridge’ connecting the two villages,” he explained.




That afternoon, the councils of Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces, which border the DMZ, signed a “peace working agreement” at Dorasan Station in Paju, in which they agreed to lead the way in inter-Korean exchange and cooperation and joint development of the Demilitarized Zone at the provincial council level. With their agreement, the councils agreed to cooperate toward preventing conflict stemming from competition at the local government level to assume control of inter-Korean exchange efforts, while considering and implementing solutions to issues affecting the border region.

Jeju Island also proposed inter-Korean exchange efforts to North Korea. Jeju Special Self-Governing Provincial Council members Kang Cheol-nam and Moon Jong-tae announced on Nov. 5 that they had delivered a letter to the North Korean delegation containing a proposal from the council’s chairperson to promote inter-Korean exchange while they were attending a Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation solidarity and meeting event for implementation of the Panmunjom Declaration and September Pyongyang Joint Declaration at the Mt. Kumgang Hotel on Nov. 3 and 4.

Universities have joined the push as well. Kangwon National University plans to become the first South Korean higher education institution to create a “peace studies” graduate school department, with master’s and doctoral programs available from the first semester of 2019. The university described “peace studies” as a discipline viewing cooperation and peace as the key tasks demanded by 21st century civilization, with the aim of achieving a paradigm shift from “warring civilizations” to “civilizations of peace.”

Moon prepares for possible reciprocal visit from Kim Jong-un to be held within the year,2018-11-06 16:58,North Korea,Lee Kyung-mi,"Given the delay of the second North Korea-US summit, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said that the schedule of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s reciprocal visit to Seoul was being arranged on the assumption that the visit would take place before the end of the year. Moon asked the National Assembly to issue a statement welcoming Kim Jong-un to Seoul while promising not to push ahead with the ratification of the Panmunjom Declaration.

To sum up the accounts provided by the floor leaders from the five parties who attended the meeting of the permanent governance deliberation body that convened at the Blue House on Nov. 5, Moon said that since the second North Korea-US summit had been delayed until next year, deliberations were underway about whether Kim Jong-un’s visit to Seoul should take place before or after the summit.

While the final decision has not been made, Moon said, preparations are being made on the assumption that the visit would take place within the year. While the Blue House had previously declined to comment on discussion of the delay of the North Korea-US summit until next year, which it described as “a matter being deliberated by North Korea and the US,” Moon’s remarks basically make the delay official.

“Chairman Kim’s and the South Korean government’s positions are not the only factors affecting efforts to arrange Chairman Kim’s visit to Seoul within the year. These efforts are inevitably impacted by the results of the North Korea-US negotiations,” Moon said, dismissing the possibility raised in some quarters of Kim visiting Seoul independently from the North Korea-US negotiations.

Participants at the meeting said that Moon told them he would “appreciate it” if the National Assembly “announced a statement welcoming Chairman Kim’s visit to Seoul.” “It’s customary for [North Koreans] to pay a reciprocal visit after we visit Pyongyang, and the leader of the northern half of the Korean Peninsula obviously hasn’t paid a reciprocal visit to Seoul yet. That’s prevented inter-Korean relations from developing, and I hope that Chairman Kim’s return visit to Seoul will finally take place and create a groundbreaking opportunity for inter-Korean relations. I think it would help if the National Assembly came together to extend a welcome, too,” Moon said.

“I suppose the President can take Chairman Kim to Mt. Halla, but if Chairman Kim wants to make a speech before the National Assembly, he must first lay some flowers at the Seoul National Cemetery in the Dongjak neighborhood and issue an apology to South Koreans and to the families of the victims of the Cheonan sinking,” said Kim Sung-tae, floor leader of the Liberty Korea Party.

Moon responded as follows: “When we visit North Korea when there’s a lack of progress in inter-Korean relations, we always have to think about whether or not to allow the South Korean delegation to be taken to sites of significance to the North Koreans, and we pay attention to how that will look in the eyes of the South Korean public. But if we put ourselves in the North Koreans’ shoes, describing such site visits as being a prerequisite to [Chairman Kim’s] return visit would probably put the North Koreans in an awkward position.” Moon also said he would not get involved in the question of whether Kim would deliver a speech before the National Assembly and asked the National Assembly to make that decision.

In regard to pressing security issues, Moon and the five floor leaders agreed to “cooperate on a nonpartisan level in order to achieve lasting peace and complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula amid cooperation and a firm alliance with the US.” The language about “cooperation and a firm alliance with the US” was reportedly included at the request of the Liberty Korea Party. Despite the commitment to nonpartisan cooperation, the ruling and opposition parties remain divided on the question of inter-Korean cooperation, including the ratification of the Pyongyang Joint Declaration.

Perhaps in recognition of the conservative opposition parties’ backlash to the ratification of the Comprehensive Military Agreement, an inter-Korean military agreement aimed at implementing the Pyongyang Joint Declaration and the Panmunjom Declaration, Moon reportedly provided a detailed explanation of the reasons why he had been forced as president to ratify it in accordance with the Inter-Korean Relations Development Act. At the same time, Moon said, “I would really like the Panmunjom Declaration to be ratified and approved, but I won’t hurry that.”

“Since the Comprehensive Military Agreement is a matter of national security, its ratification requires a debate in the National Assembly and the exercise of the National Assembly’s powers of consent,” Kim Sung-tae said.

High-level North Korea-US talks expected to be held in New York on Nov. 7-8,2018-11-05 16:49,North Korea,Hwang Joon-bum,"Two days of high-level North Korea-US talks between Workers’ Party of Korea Vice Chairman and United Front Department Director Kim Yong-chol and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will reportedly be taking place on Nov. 7 and 8 in New York.

Multiple diplomatic sources reported on Nov. 3 that the two sides had coordinated on the schedule. Kim and Pompeo are expected to have dinner together after the former’s arrival in New York on Nov. 7, with the main talks to take place the following day.""

When asked in a Nov. 2 interview with prominent Fox News anchor Sean Hannity about the current status of negotiations with the North, Pompeo replied, “I’ll have another set of conversations next week with my counterpart, the number two person.”

The “number two person” appeared to be a reference to Kim Yong-chol. US President Donald Trump also described Kim Yong-chol as North Korea’s second-in-command to reporters after the two met at the White House on June 1.

Kim’s US visit would be his second, following a previous one from late May to early June just before the June 12 North Korea-US summit. During his two-day stay in New York, Kim met with Pompeo and made a day trip to Washington, DC, where he delivered a letter from leader Kim Jong-un to Trump at the White House. Observers are now watching to see whether Kim Yong-chol arrives with another letter from Kim Jong-un for a “surprise meeting” with Trump.

The North Korea-US meeting may last even longer than two days if North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui arrives with Kim Yong-chol on the US visit for additional working-level meetings with State Department Special Representative for North Korea Policy Stephen Biegun. Biegun is also expected to accompany Pompeo on his New York visit.

“The US is prepared for working-level talks at any time,” a diplomatic source in Washington, DC, said, adding that “it all depends on whether North Korea agrees.”

The key issues discussed at the high-level talks are likely to include the date and location of a second North Korea-US summit – which the US has suggested will happen in “early 2018” – as well as the North’s denuclearization process and corresponding measures from the US, including the reduction of sanctions. The two sides are expected to square off in particular on the matter of loosening sanctions.

On Nov. 1, Kim Jong-un denounced the international community’s sanctions as “hostile forces [. . .] foolishly rampaging with dastardly sanction machinations.” In remarks on Nov. 2, Pompeo stressed that sanctions would be removed only after the US has had “the opportunity to verify that [denuclearization] has taken place.”

N. Korea threatens revival of its two-track approach of nuclear and economic development,2018-11-05 16:47,North Korea,Lee Je-hun,"North Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) printed a piece claiming Pyongyang’s so-called “two-track approach” of economic and nuclear weapon development could be revived, describing improved relations with the US and sanctions as “incompatible with each other.”

The message was seen as part of a bid to apply peripheral pressure on the US to change its stance on sanctions ahead of a high-level meeting reportedly set to take place between the two sides in New York on Nov. 7-8.

In the KCNA piece published on the afternoon of Nov. 2, North Korean Foreign Ministry’s Institute for American Studies Director Kwon Jong-gun was reported as issuing a personal commentary arguing that “the ‘two-track’ approach could be revived with addition of one more thing to the track of all-out concentration on economic development adopted by our state in April, and this change in course may be seriously re-examined.”

At the same time, the suggestion was contingent on the US “behaving in an arrogant way without listening properly to our repeated demands or showing any kind of change in attitude.”

This marks the first reference to “re-examining” the two-track approach in any remarks by a high-ranking North Korean official or major news outlet since the decision to put an end to the approach and focus North Korea’s full energies on economic construction at an Apr. 20 plenary session of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK). It’s a message that bears noting – since the same argument taken to its extreme would equate the two-track approach with leader Kim Jong-un pulling out of efforts toward “complete denuclearization” as openly pledged to South Korean President Moon Jae-in and US President Donald Trump.

As if to suggest his awareness of these severe ramifications, Kwon based his argument for re-examining the two-track approach as the “voice of the public” insisting that “we are the only ones changing, while our surrounding environment has not changed at all.” His message was that with disappointment in the US’ attitude running so high among the North Korean “public” – as opposed to Kim Jong-un and other members of the party, administration, and military – it was “now time for the US to respond in kind.”

“It’s important for Kim Jong-un to work on persuading people internally with regard to denuclearization, but he will have a lot to think about with the US’ intransigence on the sanctions issue,” said a source familiar with the situation, adding that the KCNA piece “expressed those concerns in somewhat coarse terms ahead of the high-level North Korea-US talks.”



On Nov. 1, the Rodong Sinmun newspaper quoted remarks made by Kim Jong-un during a visit to the construction site for the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourism area.

“Hostile forces are foolishly rampaging with dastardly sanction machinations to block improvements and development in our people’s welfare and force us to change and submit,” he was quoted as saying at the time.

Under current circumstances, the North Korean side may push hard on the sanctions issue at the high-level talks. In addition to the US response, the question of what “item” North Korea presents to the US in its call for loosening sanctions is another important factor.

“These talks are negotiations to get things moving forward,” a former senior South Korean official said.

“In any event, the North is also aware of the need for compromise,” the former official added.



In that sense, it’s worth nothing US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s remarks on Nov. 1 stressing the paramount importance of verification.

“It feels like a step forward that Secretary Pompeo placed the focus on ‘verification’ rather than ‘complete denuclearization,’” said a senior official in the foreign affairs and national security area – suggesting a perhaps optimistic hope that verification of the Yongbyon nuclear facility could serve as a medium for the two sides to reach an agreement.

According to multiple diplomatic sources, the current schedule for the high-level North Korea-US talks includes a dinner organized by Pompeo in New York on Nov. 7 and a main meeting on Nov. 8. Based on Pompeo’s remarks about having a conversation with “the number two person,” WPK Central Committee Vice Director Kim Yong-chol has been mentioned as the most likely person to attend the talks on the North Korean side.

Kim Jong-un emphasizes future of North Korea-China relations after joint arts performance,2018-11-05 16:40,North Korea,Park Min-hee,"After watching a combined performance by artists from China and North Korea at the Mansudae Art Theatre in Pyongyang on Nov. 3, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un declared that “the traditional amity between North Korea and China, which has overcome the numerous storms of history, will flourish and develop even more moving forward, and we have been made certain of its bright future,” according to reports in the Rodong Sinmun and Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Nov. 4.

“The performance I saw was overflowing with the warmth and affection of the people of China and North Korea,” Kim said, while expressing “gratitude from the bottom of my heart” to Chinese President Xi Jinping for arranging the visit by the Chinese artists.

North Korea’s Foreign Ministry held a welcome banquet for the visiting Chinese artists at the Koryo Hotel Pyongyang on Nov. 2, and Kim Jong-un attended the combined performance on Nov. 3. Kim was accompanied at the performance by Choe Ryong-hae and Ri Su-yong, both vice chairmen of the Workers’ Party of Korea; Kim Yo-jong, deputy director of the party’s central committee; and Culture Minister Pak Chun-nam.

At the site of the performance, Kim was greeted by Luo Shugang, China’s Minister of Culture and Tourism and the head of the group of musicians; Wang Yajun, Vice Minister of the Communist Party of China’s International Department; and Li Jinjun, Chinese ambassador to North Korea.

As interest surrounds the possibility of Chinese President Xi Jinping visiting North Korea before the end of the year, Kim’s message of friendship to China regarding the formation of an amicable relationship between the two countries is attracting attention. The schedule of Xi’s visit to North Korea is likely to depend on the results of the working-level and high-level negotiations between North Korea and the US that are resuming next week and Xi’s first summit with US President Donald Trump since the beginning of the trade war began between China and the US.

Kim said that “The visit to Pyongyang by famous Chinese artists, who brought with them the warmth of friendship, has brought great joy to our people,” and Luo Shugang expressed his gratitude for the generous hospitality offered by the North Koreans. Kim expressed his hope that the Chinese artists’ visit to Pyongyang would be “a meaningful opportunity to further develop friendship between China and North Korea” and took a commemorative photo with the Chinese artists.

During the performance, popular songs in North Korea and China were performed on stage, and the event concluded with a choir singing, “May Chinese and North Korean friendship last forever.” Following the performance, Kim came on stage and shook hands with each of the Chinese artists to congratulate them on a job well done.

China’s state-run Xinhua News reported that Kim Jong-un had attended the first joint performance by Chinese and North Korean artists and that, before the show, he had met some of the major members of the troupe of artists and taken commemorative photos with them.

Xinhua News also said that Kim had highly praised the healthy and stable development of China-North Korea bilateral relations and expressed his gratitude to Xi Jinping and the leadership of the Communist Party of China for sending Chinese artists that are beloved by the North Korean people to Pyongyang to hold a performance celebrating friendship and exchange.

South and North Korea begin trial dismantlement of guard posts surrounding DMZ,2018-11-05 16:38,North Korea,Park Min-hee,"On Nov. 4, South and North Korea hoisted yellow flags at 11 guard posts on each side of the demilitarized zone (DMZ), marking the beginning of an attempt to dismantle these guards posts on a trial basis. South and North Korea raised yellow flags that measured 4m wide and 3m tall on Sunday morning in order to clearly identify the guard posts that are being closed, South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) explained.

“The procedure to dismantle the guard posts on a trial basis began with the hoisting of the yellow flags. The flags were raised in order to increase transparency and mutual trust by enabling military officials from both sides to clearly observe and confirm progress toward dismantling the posts,” explained an MND official.

The two sides have discussed the procedure for the trial program of dismantling the guard posts using the military communication lines on the West Sea since Nov. 1.

“Moving forward, the South and North Korean military authorities will continue to work together to ensure that the removal of soldiers and equipment and demolition of the guard posts can be completed by the end of November and that the mutual verification process can also be completed by mid-December,” the MND said.

South and North Korea agreed to dismantle 11 guard posts on each side on a trial basis by the end of the year in the Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA), which was signed on Sept. 19. Then during the 10th round of general-level military talks that were held at Panmunjom on Oct. 26, they agreed to completely dismantle the guard posts in question by the end of November.

[Photo] South and North begin joint hydrographic survey of waterways near mouth of Han River,2018-11-05 16:14,North Korea,,South and North Korea commenced a joint hydrographic survey of the mouth of the Han River (Imjin River) for joint usage of its waterways on Nov. 5. It was the first joint inspection of the area since 1953. The joint survey team comprises 10 people from each side and includes both military officials and waterway experts. The team gauged the waterways’ depth using sonar to determine whether they were at safe levels for passage via boat. The joint survey was part of an inter-Korean military agreement signed by both sides on Sept. 19 during the inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang. (Yonhap News)
High-level North Korea-US talks likely to be complemented by working-level representatives,2018-11-03 15:24,North Korea,Noh Ji-won,"The high-level North Korea-US talks that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed will be held next week are likely to adopt a “2+2”format with representatives attending from working-level negotiations, a source reported.

Addressing the possibility that the North Korea-US following talks would follow a 2+2 format with senior- and working-level representatives meeting, a foreign affairs source familiar with the two sides’ negotiations told the Hankyoreh on Nov. 2 that “the US is indeed hoping for that, and there’s a pretty good likelihood that’s how it will actually happen.”

This means a strong chance that the high-level meeting between Pompeo and his North Korean counterpart – predicted to be Workers’ Party of Korea Vice Chairman and United Front Department Director Kim Yong-chol – will also be attended by the two sides’ officials in charge of working-level negotiations, namely US State Department Special Representative for North Korea Policy Stephen Biegun and North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui.

Washington’s concept appeared based on the conclusion that combining the working-level and high-level talks rather than keeping them separated would be a more efficient approach amid the current lack of progress in working-level discussions. Another source familiar with activities in Washington said, “There is absolutely no need to separate the high-level and working-level talks.”

“Working-level matters can be discussed at high-level talks and vice versa. There isn’t any need for one of them to come first,” the source said.

If Pyongyang does agree to Washington’s idea, the high-level and working-level representatives are expected either to all meet together at the North Korea-US follow-up talks next week or to meet separately at different times.


North Korea’s response to the US idea was not confirmed.

“As far as I know, the North has not sent a definite reply yet,” a foreign affairs source said.

The format could also be restricted to high-level talks depending on the response from Pyongyang. But the prevailing view among observers is that North Korea has little cause for dragging things out longer when the representatives for the working-level talks have yet to even see North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s face after his agreement to the negotiations.

After Pompeo’s meeting with Kim during a North Korean visit last month, the State Department issued an Oct. 7 press release saying Pompeo and Kim had “agreed to instruct their respective working-level teams to meet soon to intensify discussions on the key remaining issues to deliver on the Singapore Summit Joint Statement.”



Now seen as likely to adopt a 2+2 format, the follow-up talks are expected to focus on three main areas: North Korea’s concrete denuclearization process, reductions in sanctions and other corresponding measures from the US, and the schedule and agenda for a second North Korea-US summit. With Pompeo announcing that the two sides could “make a substantial breakthrough in taking down the nuclear threat from North Korea” in their next summit, many are watching to see whether concrete progress toward denuclearization negotiations can be achieved at the talks.

In terms of the denuclearization process, plans for US verification of the Punggye Village nuclear test site and Tongchang Village missile engine testing site are expected to be discussed. In an Oct. 31 interview with Laura Ingraham, Pompeo discussed the matter of a US inspection team visiting the facilities to check on the progress of denuclearization.

“It’s one of the things I’ll speak with my [North Korean] counterpart next week about,” he confirmed.



Issues surrounding sanctions against North Korea also appear likely to come up for discussion. On Nov. 1, the North’s Rodong Sinmun paper published an article quoting Kim Jong-un’s reference to “hostile forces [. . . ] foolishly rampaging with dastardly sanction machinations” ahead of the North Korea-US follow-up talks – essentially denouncing the sanctions by the US. In a radio appearance on Nov. 1, Pompeo clearly affirmed that the US is insisting on denuclearization and verification before the lifting of sanctions.

“The economic sanctions [against North Korea] will not be lifted until such time as we have had the capacity to verify that they have eliminated their nuclear program,” he said in an interview on the “Lars Larson Show.”

In another appearance on the “Mark Reardon Show,” Pompeo said, “[O]nce we’ve had the capacity, the opportunity to verify that this [denuclearization] has taken place, then and only then will the economic sanctions that have been put on North Korea be removed.”

The tug-of-war between the two sides over denuclearization measures and the removal of sanctions is seen as likely to continue in their follow-up talks.

Another key issue will be coordination of the schedule and agenda for the second North Korea-US summit, which Pompeo has said he hopes will happen early next year. The two sides are expected to narrow down the summit schedule and exchange specific ideas on the location.

In addition to the North Korea-US follow-up talks, a South Korea-US working group also appears set to begin full-scale operation. Lee Do-hoon, the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, is expected to visit the US around the same time as the follow-up talks. Around this time, the two sides are expected to hold the first meeting of the working group after a final decision on its launch during an Oct. 28–29 South Korea visit by Biegun.

Inter-Korean military information exchanges resume on illegal Chinese fishing boats near NLL,2018-11-03 15:21,North Korea,Yoo Kang-moon,"South and North Korean military authorities resumed information exchanges on Nov. 2 on third-party vessels illegally fishing in near the Northern Limit Line (NLL) area in the West (Yellow) Sea.

The resumption comes a decade after information exchanges based on inter-Korean general-level military talks in June 2004 were suspended in May 2008. The measure is another step toward preventing unintended armed clashes and establishing maritime peace and joint fishing zones in the West Sea NLL area as specified in the two sides’ Sept. 19 military agreement.

According to the South Korean Ministry of National Defense, South and North Korean military authorities exchanged information via their West Sea military communication line at 9 am that day on the current status of “illegally fishing third-country vessels” in the NLL area. The ministry explained that the measure would be “meaningful in terms of the suspension of land-, sea-, and air-based hostile activities and demilitarization of the Panmunjom Joint Security Area recently pursued by South and North Korean military authorities, as well as the establishment of peace on the Korean Peninsula.”

At general-level talks in June 2004, the two sides agreed to use the West Sea military communication line to exchange information on third-party boats illegally fishing around the NLL – the “third party” here essentially referring to China. Notifications regarding the number, position (latitude and longitude), and fishing times of Chinese boats were exchanged between the Navy’s 2nd Fleet Command at Pyeongtaek and North Korea’s West Sea Fleet Command at Nampo before the exchanges were suspended in May 2008.

By resuming their exchanges of information on Chinese boats illegally fishing around the NLL, the two sides stand to reduce the chances of an unintended clash between their militaries. The risk of a clash arose in the past due to the potential for warships on both sides to closely approach or unwittingly cross the NLL while cracking down on Chinese fishing boats. In July, the two sides resumed operation of a shared international merchant ship network to prevent unintended clashes in the West Sea and restored their military communication line for the West Sea region.

The measure is also expected to contribute to the future establishment of a maritime peace zone and inter-Korean joint fishing zone in the West Sea. With anywhere from 50 to 100 Chinese vessels descending on the waters near Baengnyeong and Yeonpyeong Islands during fishing season and clearing out the waters down to small fry, many have complained of the devastating effect this has had on the grounds. At their tenth general-level talks on Oct. 16, South and North Korea agreed to quickly establish a joint military committee to discuss establishing a maritime peace zone and joint fishing zone in the West Sea.

South and North Korea to integrate respective branches of taekwondo,2018-11-03 15:18,North Korea,Kim Dong-hoon,"The South and North Korean versions of the martial art known as taekwondo –which branched off from the same roots – will be integrated at last.

World Taekwondo (WT), which took shape in South Korea, and the International Taekwondo Federation (ITF), which developed in North Korea, signed an agreement for the growth and integration of taekwondo at the Yanggakdo International Hotel in Pyongyang on the morning of Nov. 2. The integration of the two organizations, if it takes place this year, would come 45 years after WT was established as the World Taekwondo Federation in 1973 to serve as an alternative to the ITF, which was founded in 1966.

The signing ceremony was attended by executive delegations from the two organizations, including WT President Choue Chung-won and ITF President Ri Yong-son. Choue had been in Pyongyang since Oct. 30 with a WT demonstration team at the invitation of the ITF. After the two organizations reached a general agreement during working-level negotiations the previous day, a cheerful mood prevailed during a 50-minute event on Friday that included the signing of the agreement and commemorative photos.



To begin with, the organizations agreed to set up a joint body to work toward the integration of taekwondo. The two sides are planning to decide on the name of the organization, its character and the content of its activity by this coming December.

The two organizations also agreed to engage in activities to promote the integration of taekwondo. They’re planning to push for joint demonstration performances in China, Russia, Switzerland, the US and Japan, including at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The joint body is slated to deliberate the establishment of a joint training center so that the combined demonstration performances can gradually lead to a unified demonstration team.

The WT and the ITF also agreed to hold joint international competitions on a trial basis that will be held under their respective playing rules. The two sides plan to recognize each other’s belt titles and judge licenses so that taekwondo athletes who belong to the two organizations can participate in international competitions hosted by both sides, including continental and global tournaments.



Whereas the South Korean WT has more of a focus on sports, the North Korean ITF emphasizes its traditional martial arts aspects. WT practitioners study basic moves, forms, sparring, breaking boards and self-defense, with WT sparring becoming an official Olympic event during the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The areas studied in the ITF are basic moves, forms, sparring, power breaking and special techniques. South Korean taekwondo athletes wear protective gear on the head and body, but North Korean taekwondo is more violent, with athletes landing punches to the face while wearing a mouthpiece, gloves and soft shoes without soles.

On Friday, the two organizations also decided to seriously discuss the idea of submitting a joint petition to UNESCO to register taekwondo as an intangible cultural heritage. They will also be holding working-level deliberations once a month at an agreed-upon location to ensure the continuing implementation of the agreements reached on Friday.

The ITF was founded in Seoul in 1966 by Choi Hong-hi, the first chairman of the Korea Taekwondo Association. Because of friction with the government of South Korean President Park Chung-hee, Choi sought asylum in Canada in 1972 and then established his version of taekwondo in North Korea during a visit to Pyongyang in 1979. In 1973, shortly after Choi left the country, Kim Un-yong, then a councilor at the South Korean embassy to the US, established the WT on the orders of the Park administration. The two organizations have been at odds for more than 40 years while competing to increase the number of their respective member countries.

On Friday, WT President Choue Chung-won pointed out that next year marked the 25th year since taekwondo was adopted as an official Olympic event during the 1994 meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Paris and proposed that the two sides hold a joint performance to mark the occasion in Lausanne, Switzerland, where the IOC headquarters is located. ITF President Ri Yong-son gladly accepted the proposal and said he would definitely be there.

But the IFT did not accept a proposal by the WT to set up an ITF national association in Pyongyang to help North Korean athletes take part in the Olympics. Perhaps in reference to this proposal, Ri Yong-son commented that “if you gulp down water too fast, you can choke on it.”



In related news, South and North Korea convened a meeting of the sports subcommittee at the Inter-Korean Liaison Office in Kaesong on Friday, with their teams of negotiators headed by South Korean Second Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism Roh Tae-kang and North Korean Deputy Minister Ministry of Sports Won Kil-u. During the meeting, the two sides agreed to send a letter to the IOC expressing their desire to host the 2032 Summer Olympics together.

Furthermore, South and North Korea agreed in principle to send unified teams to international sporting events, including the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and to deliberate this issue with the IOC and with international athletic organizations representing each event. Accordingly, they will be sending a combined team to the handball world championship that will be held in Germany and Denmark in January 2019.

Kim Jong-un targets sanctions in remarks quoted in N. Korea’s Rodong Sinmun,2018-11-02 17:43,North Korea,Lee Je-hun,"The battle of nerves between Pyongyang and Washington over the North Korea sanctions issue is heating up again as the two sides resume their dialogue, with high-level talks reportedly set to take place in the US next week to prepare for a second bilateral summit.

In stories on the front and second pages of its Nov. 1 edition, the Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK), quoted North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as saying during a visit to the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourism area construction site that “hostile forces are foolishly rampaging with dastardly sanction machinations to block improvements and development in our people’s welfare and force us to change and submit.”

While Kim’s remarks were focused more on the “injustice” of the sanctions than on a call for their lifting, it is seen as unusual for him to mention the issue publicly ahead of the high-level talks with the US.

The reference to sanctions was not the first by Kim. In its Aug. 17 edition, the Rodong Sinmun quoted Kim as saying during another visit to the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourism area site that the construction effort was part of an “intense confrontation with hostile forces who seek to suffocate our people with a forceful blockade of sanctions.”

During his August visit, Kim pushed the zone’s completion date back six months to “October 10 of next year” (the anniversary of the WPK’s establishment) from the Apr. 15 date (the Day of the Sun holiday, founding leader Kim Il-sung’s birthday) mentioned during his first visit in May. Analysts saw the measure as based on a determination that the lifting of sanctions by the US would happen later than initially planned.

Kim’s visit to the Wonsan coastal tourism area was his third this year. The Rodong Sinmun also reported on Oct. 30 that Kim had given on-the-spot guidance in Samjiyon County for a third time in 2018. The efforts were seen as intended to personally check on and encourage the four major construction projects emphasized in his New Year’s address.

During his visit to the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourism area, Kim said the “country’s situation is difficult at the moment,” but added, “I can already see the day before long when [Wonsan’s Myongsasimni Beach] is crowded with people.”



Meanwhile, the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a financial transaction advisory on Oct. 31 warning that North Korea presents a risk of laundering money and terrorism financing, Voice of America reported on Nov. 1. In its advisory, FinCEN said the OECD-affiliate Financial Action Task Force (FATF) had urged member countries to take response actions against North Korea to protect the international financial system from money laundering and terrorist financing risk factors.

It went on to provide a detailed four-page explanation including information on the major content of related UN Security Council resolutions and independent sanctions by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) based on an executive order by the US President.

FinCEN previously issued an identical advisory on Oct. 21. With its renewed advisory, the Treasury Department appears to be a stronger signal that sanctions against North Korea are to be kept in place following FATF designating North Korea once again as a state requiring response measures.

Blue House confirms Kim Jong-un likely to visit Seoul within the year,2018-11-02 17:40,North Korea,Kim Bo-hyeop,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may pay a reciprocal visit to the South Korea within the year as agreed upon by the two sides’ leaders in their Pyongyang Joint Declaration last September, the Blue House suggested on Nov. 1.

“We see [Kim’s South Korea visit] as proceeding without issues,” a Blue House senior official said in a meeting with reporters that day, adding that the two sides would “continue our discussions.”

“The timeline for Chairman Kim’s reciprocal visit is open. While there may be some variability as the situation progresses, we’re definitely looking at a reciprocal visit in the short term,” the official added.

“We look forward to Chairman Kim visiting within the year,” the official said.

When asked about a possible connection to the schedule for a second North Korea-US summit, the official replied, “I don’t see it as necessarily being greatly tied to that [summit].” The message appeared to suggest the two sides would be pursuing a Seoul visit by Kim within 2018 without being greatly affected by the schedule for the second North Korea-US summit.

The ideal Korean Peninsula peace process envisioned in the past by the Blue House involved a second North Korea-US summit followed by a trilateral declaration ending the Korean War and a reciprocal South Korea visit by Kim. This was based on the need for progress in North Korea-US negotiations – which have involved a tug-of-war over denuclearization and North Korean regime security guarantees – to broaden the scope of dialogue for the South and North Korean leaders.

Amid the growing likelihood that the second North Korea-US summit will have to wait until early next year, some have speculated the timelines for the end-of-war declaration and Kim’s reciprocal visit would also be postponed in turn. With its latest announcement, the Blue House raised the possibility of a visit being pursued independently. Analysts predicted a reciprocal visit by Kim that is not tied to the North Korea-US summit may be an event both domestically and internationally indicating his strong commitment to denuclearization and degree of confidence. It may also be taken as a signal of commitment to continued advancements in inter-Korean relations through observance of the terms agreed upon by the South and North Korean leaders in their Pyongyang Joint Declaration last September.

During a radio interview with Laura Ingraham, in response to a question regarding North Korea’s preparations for international inspections of its nuclear test sites, Pompeo said he’ll discuss the issue with his North Korean “counterpart” next week. The counterpart Pompeo referred to will most likely be North Korean United Front Department Director Kim Yong-chol."

The cessation of such military activity was in accordance with the inter-Korean military agreement reached during the summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Sept. 19 in Pyongyang.

All hostile activity around MDL to cease in accordance with inter-Korean military agreement,2018-11-01 16:23,North Korea,Yoo Kang-moon,"All land-, sea-, and air-based hostile activities around the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) are to be halted as of Nov. 1 in accordance with the military agreement reached by South and North Korea on Sept. 19.

“As of 00 hours on Nov. 1, South and North Korean military authorities will suspend all mutually directed hostile activities on land and sea and in the air,” the Ministry of National Defense announced on Oct. 31.

In their Sept. 19, military agreement, the two sides stipulated that they would be ceasing all live-fire artillery drills and field training exercises at the regiment level and above within 5km of the MDL, designate and operate no-fly zones for all aircraft types, and suspend live-fire and maritime maneuver exercises within buffer zones in the East and West (Yellow) Seas.

“To this end, covers have been placed on the muzzles and barrels of warship and coastal artillery units in the East and West Sea buffer zones, and gun ports have been closed on all coastal artillery on Yeonpyeong and Baengnyeong Islands,” the ministry said.

“No-fly zones have been proclaimed internally and internationally through Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) for different aircraft types,” it added. In terms of new operational procedures to prevent unintended armed clashes, the ministry said Joint Chiefs of Staff and operational command field regulations had been revised and instruction provided to local units.

“In terms of the mutual full-scale suspension of hostile activities, the North Korean side officially stated at the tenth general officer-level military talks that it would be thoroughly implementing and complying with the hostility suspension measures stipulated in the military agreement as of 00 hours on Nov. 1,” the ministry continued. According to the ministry’s explanation, North Korea has been implementing the suspension measures indicated in the agreement, including the recent closing of gun ports on its West Sea coastal artillery.

“The mutual suspension of land-, sea-, and air-based hostile activities implemented by South Korean military authorities as of Nov. 1 in accordance with the Sept. 19 military agreement will represent a practical measure to relax military tensions between South and North and promote the building of trust,” the ministry said.

“This will be a meaningful step in terms of ushering forward the Korean Peninsula’s denuclearization and establishment of permanent peace,” it continued.

“The UN Command (US Forces Korea Command) has repeatedly expressed its support for all measures related to the full-scale mutual suspension of land-, sea-, and air-based hostile activities,” the ministry stressed.

S. Korea and US to establish working group for N. Korea’s denuclearization and US measures,2018-11-01 16:21,North Korea,Noh Ji-won,"South Korea and the US have decided to set up a working group to beef up bilateral coordination on North Korea’s denuclearization and corresponding US measures, along with the eventual establishment of a peace regime. Set for a launch next month, the working group is to be a pan-governmental control tower centering on the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) with staff participating from related agencies. Active discussions on granting exemptions to sanctions as a way of driving inter-Korean cooperation are expected to take place.

Meeting with reporters on Oct. 31, a MOFA senior official explained the framework while sharing the concept of the group’s operation. Lee Do-hoon, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, and Stephen Biegun, US State Department special representative for North Korea policy, are seen as likely to serve as the two sides’ representatives, with MOFA and the US State Department serving as the group’s central axis while staff from other agencies participate under a fluid framework as required according to individual issues.

The two sides reportedly agreed on the need to establish a working group to build a permanent system for increased bilateral communication and cooperation as the processes of inter-Korean cooperation and North Korean denuclearization intensify going ahead.

“The working group’s biggest aim is about how to get South Korea and US communicating well and often,” the official said, adding that the discussions advanced over the course of 14 meetings between Lee and Biegun were “meaningful in terms of making things regular, official, and systematic.”

The working group’s actual main roles are to be twofold. First, it will serve as a way for the two sides to share strategies for North Korea’s denuclearization and corresponding US measures, along with the establishment of a peace regime.

“An end-of-war declaration lies at the entrance of establishing a peace regime, and the signing of a peace agreement lies at the exit,” the official explained – hinting that the group will also be discussing the process toward a declaration officially ending the Korean War and the signing of a peace agreement.

The second role involves beefing up the close coordination needed between to implement the terms of inter-Korean cooperation pledged by the South and North Korean leaders in their Panmunjom Declaration and Pyongyang Joint Declaration.

“Our government is ushering [inter-Korean cooperation projects] forward under the sanctions framework, and we’re discussing whether we need to request exemptions to the sanctions,” the official explained, adding that “the working group will be capable” of holding those discussions. The US is reportedly not opposed to inter-Korean cooperation projects per se as long as they are discussed closely between Seoul and Washington.



Addressing concerns from some quarters that the US proposed the working group as a way of throwing brakes on the recent momentum in inter-Korean relations, the official said, “We are the ones who suggested it, and the discussions have been taking place for several months.”

Reporting on Biegun’s visit to South Korea between Oct. 28 and 30, US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Robert Palladino said on Oct. 30 that the trip’s purpose was “to discuss diplomatic efforts to achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization (FFVD) of North Korea.”

“As part of that, the two [South Korean and US] governments agreed on establishing a new working group that would further strengthen our close coordination on our diplomacy, on our denuclearization efforts, on sanctions implementation, and inter-Korean cooperation that comply with the United Nations sanctions,” he explained.

When asked during the briefing whether there had been any “disagreement” between Washington and Seoul, Palladino replied, “The United States and the Republic of Korea are closely coordinating on our joint approach, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We’ll continue to do so.”



A Blue House source also reported that Biegun had had a separate meeting with Yoon Geon-young, government situation room director, prior to meeting National Security Office Director Chung Eui-yong at the Blue House the day before. The meeting took place at the US’ request.

“The government situation room is in charge of general affairs for inter-Korean summits, and Mr. Yoon not only has experience communicating with North Korean figures while visiting with Chung when he was sent to North Korea as a special envoy for the first summit, but also present at the second inter-Korean summit at Panmungak,” a Blue House official said.

“Mr. Biegun appears to have regarded Mr. Yoon as a working-level official at the Blue House with whom he should be meeting,” the official added.

Observers have speculated that Biegun’s decision to meet with Blue House Chief of Staff Im Jong-seok and Yoon rather than the “official line” working on the denuclearization issue may be based on his intention to coordinate perspectives between Seoul and Washington and “slow the roll” of developments in economic cooperation.

“My understanding is that Mr. Biegun did not make any explicit requests along those lines,” a Blue House senior official said in a telephone interview with the Hankyoreh.

“But he did apparently focus on expressing his wish to strengthen systematic communication centering on him as the person in charge of North Korea policy,” the official added.

Biegun’s visit to South Korea gave the strong impression of being intended to strengthen his own stature within the State Department as the official in charge of North Korea policy rather than to coordinate the two sides’ views on the Korean Peninsula peace process. Observers also suggested it was intended to make up for the lack of smooth communication within Washington’s foreign affairs line despite the ongoing channels of communication between the two sides – including ones connecting Chung with White House National Security Advisor John Bolton, Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Kyung-wha with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Biegun with Lee Do-hoon.

Indeed, a communication breakdown within the US government was named as being largely to blame for Pompeo’s message of “protest” to Kang regarding the inter-Korean military agreement shortly before the third inter-Korean summit. Kang is reported to have advised Pompeo at the time to “check internally on your [US] side.”

Kim Yong-chol to meet with Pompeo in US next week,2018-10-31 16:55,North Korea,Hwang Joon-bum,"A high-level meeting between Workers’ Party of Korea vice chairman and North Korean United Front Department Director Kim Yong-chol and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will reportedly be taking place in the US around the later part of next week.

Discussions in preparation for a second North Korea-US summit expected to take place early next year appear poised to gain momentum.

According to the account of a diplomatic source in Washington on Oct. 30, the two sides have effectively finished coordination toward holding the high-level talks - previously mentioned by Pompeo on Oct. 19 – sometime around late next week soon after the US midterm elections on Nov. 6. The most likely venue is to be New York City, where North Korea’s UN mission is located, although Washington, DC, has also been mentioned.

A South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs senior official said Seoul and Washington shared a schedule and agenda for the high-level talks during an Oct. 30 visit by US State Department Special Representative for North Korea Policy Stephen Biegun. After arriving in South Korea on Oct. 28, Biegun met on Oct. 29 with Blue House Chief of Staff Im Jong-seok, Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Kyung-hwa, and Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs Lee Do-hoon.

In remarks on Oct. 19, Pompeo said, “I’m very hopeful we’ll have senior leader meetings here in the next week and a half or so [in late October] between myself and my counterpart.” The two sides reportedly planned to hold high-level talks around late October, but ended up delaying them due to the situation on the US side. Kim is seen as likely to be North Korea’s counterpart in the meeting with Pompeo.




If Kim does attend the high-level talks next week, it will be his second visit to the US. The likelihood of him meeting US President Donald Trump appears slim, as Trump is scheduled to attend a centennial ceremony in Paris on Nov. 11 to commemorate the end of the First World War.
The date and venue for the second North Korea-US summit appear likely to be key issues at the high-level talks.

On Oct. 22, White House National Security Advisor John Bolton predicted the summit would take place after Jan. 1. Trump said on Oct. 9 that “three or four locations” other than the US and Singapore were being discussed. The US is reportedly in favor of holding the summit in a neutral third country in Europe such as Switzerland or Sweden.



The high-level talks are also expected to include discussions on North Korea’s denuclearization measures and corresponding measures from the US. North Korea has invited inspectors to its Punggye Village nuclear test site and announced its intent to dismantle its engine testing site and missile launch pad at Tongchang Village; it has also announced its willingness to dismantle its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, contingent on corresponding measures from Washington.

While Pyongyang has been vocal in demanding the loosening of sanctions and a declaration ending the Korean War from the US, Washington has countered that sanctions will not relaxed without denuclearization.

Discussions on the issues of denuclearization and corresponding measures appear likely to continue after the high-level talks at a follow-up meeting next month between Biegun and North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui.

On the afternoon of Oct. 30, Biegun met with South Korean National Security Office director Chung Eui-yong to discuss the Korean Peninsula political situation in general and plans for close coordination and cooperation between the two sides in the process of advancing inter-Korean and North Korea-US relations. During his two-day visit, Biegun met with the full range of senior South Korean government officials in the areas of foreign affairs and national security, including his counterpart Lee Do-hoon as well as the Blue House National Security Office director and chief of staff and the Minister of Unification and Foreign Affairs.

Earlier, Biegun traveled to the Central Government Complex in Seoul to meet with Minister of Unification Cho Myoung-gyon. In their meeting, Biegun stressed that Seoul and Washington “want the same thing for the Korean Peninsula: peace and stability, primarily through denuclearization of North Korea.”

“There are many initiatives that we can cooperate on, and we are looking forward to working closely between the ministry and the US,” he continued.

Biegun also told Cho he was meeting his Ministry of Foreign Affairs counterpart Lee Do-hoon that evening for the 14th time since assuming his position on Aug. 23, adding that the importance of close partnership between the US and South Korea was being emphasized in all cases.

Cho replied that the current moment is “a very important time.”

“I am glad that your visit means discussions on plans for close cooperation between our two sides in connection with advancing inter-Korean and US-North Korea relations,” he told Biegun.

Inter-Korean goodwill matches of young soccer players foster environment of unity and friendship,2018-10-30 17:15,North Korea,Kim Chang-keum,"“Shoot!”

“Oh no...”

The 15,000 spectators packing the stands at the Songam Leports Town main stadium in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, on Oct. 29 let out cries of excitement and frustration every time the South or North Korean team got hold of the ball and made for the goalposts. They did not take sides – seemingly unconcerned with who might win. In the stands, placards read “We are one.” Students holding up a Korean Peninsula flag cried out “Daehanminguk!” (literally “Republic of Korea”; a popular chant at sporting events) and helped energize the players, who were competing hard despite the nippy weather.

“I don’t care who wins,” said one South Korean senior citizen spectator who hails originally from the North Korean province of Hwanghae. “I just hope we’ll keep meeting and having exchanges like this often.”


The event that day was the official opening match of the 5th Ari Sports Cup international U-15 soccer championship (Oct. 28–Nov. 22), with North Korea’s April 25 Sports Club youth team claiming a 3-1 win over a Gangwon Province all-star team. The North Korean side overwhelmed the South Korean players with their robust builds and well-crafted plays.

“It’d be nice if we can come and go and share friendship often in the not-too-distant future,” said North Korean #11 Ri Il-song, who scored two goals that day, adding his team’s victory “will make my parents, friends, and teachers back home happy.” The April 25 Sports Club girls’ team previously beat a Hana Bank Middle School Federation all-star team 2-0 in an unscheduled inter-Korean goodwill match.

As though representative of the current climate of inter-Korean reconciliation, the players from the April 25 and Gangwon teams went around the track after the match giving thanks to the crowd together. The April 25 and Hana Bank girls’ teams also joined on the grounds to wave toward the crowds. Gangwon Gov. Choi Moon-soon, North Korean captain Mun Ung, and the South and North Korean players shouted “we are one” as a commemorative photograph was taken before the match.

The 5th Ari Sports Cup drew major attention from the domestic and foreign media that day as the Chuncheon event marked the competition’s return to South Korea – the site of its first edition in 2014 in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi Province – after previously being held in Pyongyang, Kunming, and again in Pyongyang last August.

“This competition also had eight teams participating from eight countries (South and North Korea, China, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Iran),” said South and North Korean Sports Exchange Association chairman Kim Gyeong-seong, who has played a leading role in inter-Korean sports exchange efforts since 2006.

“With the regular hosting of this competition, we’ve established a framework,” he added.


“We’re planning to invite Real Madrid from Europe and other famous youth team for the sixth event next year, which is scheduled to take place in Wonsan, North Korea,” Kim said.
Choi Moon-soon stressed, “Friendship is more important than victory.”

“Sports exchange is bringing South and North closer,” he said.

US in direct correspondence with N. Korean lieutenant general regarding POW/MIA remains,2018-10-30 17:06,North Korea,Lee Je-hun,"Kelly McKeague, director of the US Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), has been directly corresponding with North Korean Lieutenant General An Ik-san to discuss the recovery of the remains of US soldiers killed in North Korean territory during the Korean War. This discussion includes details such as the timeframe, method and conditions for the exhumation efforts, which were agreed to in the joint statement signed by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump on June 12.

“During the letters I’ve exchanged with North Korean Lieutenant General An Ik-san, we’ve discussed concrete details such as the timeframe of the recovery. I sent my most recent letter to An three weeks ago,” McKeague said. He made these remarks during an interview that took place when a South Korean delegation from the South Korea-US Security Forum visited DPAA, which is located at the US Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii, on Oct. 23.

“My most recent letter deals with related areas of progress, including the fact that the proposal we’re going to give North Korea hasn’t been finalized but probably will be within two weeks,” McKeague said, without getting into the details of the proposal that the US government is working on.

“DPAA is directly responsible for the recovery of remains,” McKeague said, adding that he’d “received permission from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to directly contact An Ik-san for deliberations” without specifying the timing. McKeague emphasized that DPAA has been authorized by Pompeo to “contact and deliberate with the North Koreans regardless of whether there is progress toward denuclearization.”

“Lieutenant General An and I have been exchanging letters by way of the North Korean [and American] delegations to the UN in New York,” McKeague added.

In a statement released on July 15, Pompeo said that North Korea and the US “agreed to re-commence field operations in the DPRK to search for the estimated 5,300 Americans who never returned home” during general-level military talks that were held between the UN Command and the North Korean military at Panmunjom on the same day. At the time, Pompeo did not mention any of the details of the recovery operations, such as timeframe or method, but the correspondence with An Ik-san mentioned by McKeague appears to serve as the follow-up deliberations to those general-level talks.

“Next year, we’re planning to work on recovering the remains of American soldiers in 47 countries around the world, and North Korea is obviously one of those. But the final decision hasn’t been made on the question of recovering remains in the North Korean region,” McKeague said.

“I hope our deliberations with North Korea will go well so that we can resume the recovery efforts with the North Koreans at Jangjin Lake and Unsan County in March of next year,” McKeague said, adding that “By our calculations, over a thousand American soldiers were lost around Jangjin Lake and over a thousand were lost around Unsan County during the Korean War.”

An Ik-san, whom McKeague has identified as his counterpart in the negotiations, is one of the top negotiators in the North Korean military, and he’s in charge of the North Korean People’s Army’s delegations to general-level military talks with the UN Command and with South Korea. McKeague said that An also attended the repatriation ceremony of the remains of American soldiers that took place at Wonsan’s Kalma Airport on July 27.



Jennie Jin (Korean name Jin Ju-hyeon), an anthropologist who works at DPAA’s Central Identification Laboratory, was at Wonsan when the remains were repatriated. “When we arrived at Wonsan, the North Koreans were well-prepared; for each of the 55 boxes [containing the remains of American soldiers], they’d brought personal effects and detailed records of their recovery. Thanks to that, the work proceeded in a very amicable atmosphere,” Jin said.

“Because so much time has passed, none of the 55 boxes sent by the North Koreans contain the complete remains. But in September, we managed to identity two American soldiers. With one of two identified soldiers, the North Korean officials’ hints were a big help because they gave us a set of dog tags and said the owner of the tags was definitely in a certain box or one of the boxes around it,” Jin said.

“Some people say that some of the remains of American soldiers that North Korea has sent are actually animal bones, but that’s not true. So far, the North Koreans have never sent the US animal bones.”

Biegun meets with Blue House chief of staff to discuss inter-Korean cooperation,2018-10-30 17:03,North Korea,Noh Ji-won,"On Oct. 29, US Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun had a one-hour meeting with Blue House Chief of Staff Im Jong-seok, during which the two worked to harmonize the two sides’ positions on inter-Korean cooperation projects. During earlier meetings with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and Lee Do-hoon, South Korea's special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, Biegun promised that the US would “cooperate closely” with South Korea on improving not only North Korea-US relations but also inter-Korean relations.

The meeting between Im and Biegun, which was held at the request of the US, was inherently unusual. While it’s true that Im also chairs a committee charged with implementing inter-Korean summit declarations, matters concerning foreign policy and security, including establishing peace and denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, are in the portfolio of Blue House National Security Office Director Chung Eui-yong.

The Blue House explained that Im asked Biegun to bring the North Korea-US talks to a successful conclusion and that Biegun asked the South Korean government for assistance, without providing any details about the meeting. But since a senior government official said that Biegun’s visit to South Korea was focused more on aligning South Korea and the US’s positions than on working-level meetings between North Korea and the US, it would appear that Biegun and Im’s discussion focused on resolving disagreements between South Korea and the US over inter-Korean cooperation projects, including the connection of inter-Korean roads and railways and businesspeople visiting the Kaesong Industrial Complex to inspect their facilities there.

Such trends in the US government may have played a role in Biegun’s surprising visit to Seoul so soon after holding deliberations in Washington just last week with Lee Do-hoon, observers say.

In a related story, Biegun met with Kang Kyung-wha on Monday morning for 45 minutes, longer than the 30 minutes that had originally been scheduled. Kang dedicated a considerable amount of time not only to hearing from Biegun about progress in North Korea-US relations, including the high-level talks and working-level talks, but also to sharing opinions about progress in inter-Korean relations, and she reportedly expressed her agreement with the need for close communication and cooperation between South Korea and the US.

The urgent inter-Korean cooperation projects that the two sides need to discuss include tenant business owners visiting the Kaesong Complex and linking South and North Korea’s roads and railways. South Korea and the US are reportedly putting considerable weight on bilateral cooperation on matters including asking the UN Security Council to provide an exemption from sanctions for inter-Korean cooperation projects such as the inter-Korean joint survey of the Gyeongui (Seoul-Sinuiju) and East Sea railroads and a groundbreaking ceremony before the end of the year.

Biegun continued related discussions during meetings with Chung Eui-yong and Minister of Unification Cho Myoung-gyon on the afternoon of Oct. 30. Cho addressed this issue during a parliamentary audit of the Unification Ministry at the National Assembly’s Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee on Monday. In regard to the issue of the joint survey of the Gyeongui line, Cho said, “The US isn’t at the point where it’s expressing opposition to inter-Korean projects. We’re in a rather cooperative phase in which we’re continuing our discussions with the US.”

Cho did acknowledge that “there are some areas where our ideas are somewhat different from the Americans.”

In connection with the issue of denuclearization, Biegun said during his meeting with Lee Do-hoon that the US is completely certain that the goal of North Korea’s final, fully verified denuclearization is capable of being realized. Just when concerns are being raised that the North Korea-US negotiations are at an impasse, an official involved in North Korea-US working level talks has expressed his optimism about those negotiations.

South and North Korea complete removal of outposts and firearms from JSA,2018-10-29 17:54,North Korea,Yoo Kang-moon,"South and North Korea’s joint verification of the removal of outposts and firearms from the Joint Security Area (JSA) at Panmunjom was completed on schedule on Oct. 27, leading to expectations that civilians and tourists will be able to access the area freely as early as the beginning of November.

“During the two days from Oct. 26 to 27, South Korea, North Korea and the UN Command carried out a joint verification of the measures to demilitarize the JSA. Nothing unusual was found during the joint verification,” an official from South Korea’s Defense Ministry said on Oct. 28.


The decision to demilitarize the JSA was made in the Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA), which was signed on Sept. 19. In accordance with this agreement, South and North Korea worked on clearing mines from Oct. 1 to 20, removed all firearms and military personnel from five North Korean guard posts and four South Korean guard posts in the JSA through Oct. 25 and verified this work along with the UN Command from Oct. 26 to 27.

In order to enable civilians and tourists to travel freely in the area, South Korea, North Korea and the UN Command are planning to continue setting up new guard posts and adding surveillance equipment.

“We believe that free travel will become possible as early as next month and within the year at the latest,” the Defense Ministry official said.

Moon expresses willingness to give Kim Jong-un tour of Mt. Halla during reciprocal visit to Seoul,2018-10-29 17:53,North Korea,Kim Bo-hyeop,"On Oct. 28, South Korean President Moon Jae-in mentioned the Korean expression “from Mt. Baekdu to Mt. Halla” while saying he would be willing to give North Korean leader Kim Jong-un a tour of Mt. Halla if he wants to during his reciprocal visit to Seoul.

Moon made the remarks on the morning of Oct. 28 in response to a question about Kim’s visit while he was hiking on Mt. Bugak, behind the Blue House, with Blue House press corps.

“I received such a warm welcome on my last visit [to North Korea] that I’m not sure where I ought to take Chairman Kim when he actually pays a return visit. Since the schedule hasn’t been nailed down, we aren’t making any plans yet. We still don’t know how much time he’ll be spending here, but once the schedule is set we’ll work within those parameters,” Moon added.

When Moon was asked which goals he wants the government to focus on with barely two months left in the year, he chose the areas of the economy and the peace process on the Korean Peninsula.

“If this were a household, I guess we could do home repairs this month and get ready for winter next month, but when you’re running the government, multiple projects have to move forward simultaneously,” Moon observed.

“Both in terms of foreign policy and the economy, there’s a lot of work to do. And so that’s not an easy question to answer, but at any rate we’ll be working with North Korea on the one hand and with the US on the other hand to ensure the ongoing peace process does not fail and we make the most of opportunities,” he said.

While Kim and Moon reached an agreement in Panmunjom on Apr. 27 to formally declare the end of the Korean War within the year and agreed in the Pyongyang Joint Declaration, signed on Sept. 19, that Kim would pay a reciprocal visit to Seoul. Carrying out those agreements will depend on Kim’s second summit with US President Donald Trump. As such, Moon’s remarks are taken to mean he will put an even greater effort into mediating between North Korea and the US and facilitating an improvement in their relations with the goal of bringing peace and denuclearization to the Korean Peninsula.


Moon made the following remarks about economic problems: “We’ll continue providing relief for difficulties with the public livelihood, which are evident to the public whatever the macro economic indicators may say, while also energetically moving ahead with our policy platform of income-led growth, innovative growth and a fair economy. The conclusion of this session of the National Assembly will be crucial toward this end. We need a lot of legislative support, and in that sense we’ll do our best to cooperate with the National Assembly to ensure that the necessary budget bill passes.”

On Nov. 1, Moon will be delivering an administrative policy speech to the National Assembly in which he asks both the ruling and opposition parties for their cooperation in passing the budget bill and other legislation.

The hike on Sunday began around 11 am at Hongryeon Temple on the east side of Mt. Bukak and lasted for two hours, passing through Sukjeong Gate, along the Baegak Valley fortifications and Cheongundae to Changui Gate. Moon was accompanied by Lim Jong-seok, his chief of staff, along with a number of his senior secretaries, including Han Byeong-do (political affairs), Cho Guk (civil affairs), Lee Yong-seon (civic society), Yoon Young-chan (public relations) and Jung Tae-ho (jobs).

S. Korea to provide US$8.6 mln in support to repair facilities at inter-Korean joint liaison office,2018-10-25 15:19,North Korea,Noh Ji-won,"The South Korean government is providing 9.78 billion won (US$8.6 million) in inter-Korean cooperation fund support to cover facility repairs and renovations carried out ahead of the opening of an inter-Korean joint liaison office in the Kaesong Industrial Complex

At a 298th Inter-Korean Exchange and Cooperation Promotion Council meeting on Oct. 17–24, the South Korean government approved a plan to use the inter-Korean cooperation fund to support repairs and renovations for the office’s opening, the Ministry of Unification reported on Oct. 24. As of late September, costs of 9.78 billion won (US$8.6 million) were incurred with supervision, adjustment, and other verification procedures after the majority of repair and renovation work was completed.

Participants in the council including vice minister-level officials from the Ministry of Economy and Finance; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Justice; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy; and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. Participating experts included Seoul National University Professor Kim Byung-yeon, University of North Korean Studies Professor Kim Sung-kyung, Dongguk University Professor Kim Yong-hyun, Korea Women's Institute for Peace Studies Director Kim Jeong-su, and Handong University Professor Kim Joon-hyung.

In their Apr. 27 Panmunjom Declaration, South and North Korea agreed to establish a joint inter-Korean liaison office; in high-level talks on June 1, it was agreed that the office would be opened in the Kaesong Complex. Since July 16, construction workers have been present at the site carrying out repair and renovations as needed for related facilities, including the building to house the office, room and board to permanent employees, and filtration/drainage and wastewater/waste treatment sites.

South and North Korea to hold 10th round of general-level military talks,2018-10-25 15:17,North Korea,Yoo Kang-moon,"South and North Korea are holding a tenth round of general-level military talks at Panmunjom on Oct. 26 to discuss the composition and management of an Inter-Korean Joint Military Committee to implement the military agreement (Comprehensive Military Agreement, or CMA) adopted alongside the Pyongyang Joint Declaration on Sept. 19.

The CMA states that the two sides’ agreement to operate an Inter-Korean Joint Military Committee to consult on “matters including large-scale military exercises and military buildup aimed at each other, various forms of blockade, interdiction and obstruction of navigation as well as reconnaissance activities against each other,” in addition to establishing a maritime peace zone and joint fishing zone in the West (Yellow) Sea region.

For the committee’s composition and management, the South Korean government plans to apply a May 1992 agreement on Inter-Korean Joint Military Committee formation and operation, it was reported on Oct. 24. At the time, South and North agreed to form a committee consisting of one vice minister-level chairperson, one deputy chairperson, and five additional members from each side. According to that agreement, meetings were to be held once a quarter as a rule, with the possibility of additional meetings to be formed by the two sides as needed.



Vice minister of national defense Suh Choo-suk is seen as a likely candidate to serve as the committee’s South Korean chairperson. On the North Korean side, one of the vice ministers from the Ministry of People’s Armed Forces is expected to serve as chairperson. North Korea’s Ministry of People’s Armed Forces has multiple vice ministers with different roles, including first vice minister So Hong-chan. In view of the stature of the talks, the South Korean Ministry of National Defense is reportedly hoping So will serve as North Korean chairperson.

But with So’s area of specialization as first vice minister bearing little connection to inter-Korean talks or military diplomacy, observers are waiting in anticipation of North Korea’s choice. As a general, So also reportedly serves as director of the General Rear Services Department, which is in charge of food, clothing, and other material supplies. Another vice minister, Lt. Gen. Kim Hyong-ryong, is in charge of military diplomacy for the ministry. Accordingly, some are predicting that Kim, who is responsible for military diplomacy as a vice minister, could participate as chairperson on the North Korean side.

As it happens, So and Kim are both attending the Xiangshan Forum, a multilateral security dialogue meeting in Beijing from Oct. 24 to 26. The forum, which is being attended by senior defense officials and security experts from 67 countries in the Asia/Pacific region, Europe, and Africa, includes discussions on international security cooperation, terrorism, and the new dynamics in Northeast Asia. The South Korean Ministry of National Defense said there were no plans for their separate meeting, but the possibility cannot be ruled out.



Once the Inter-Korean Joint Military Committee is established, the issue of standards for determining the extent of the West Sea maritime peace zone and joint fishing zone will come up for discussion. Seoul is adamant that the Northern Limit Line (NLL) should serve as the standard, while Pyongyang is expected to continue insisting on its own security boundary line standard. Some observers fear the committee could end up adrift in the debate over the NLL.

The general-level talks are also expected to assess developments in the implementation situation since the Sept. 19 military agreement was reached and a schedule for future implementation. In November, the two sides are to initiate practical measures to suspend hostile actions, including a halt to regiment-level exercises in the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) area, the application of no fly zones, and a suspension of live-fire drills and marine action exercises in buffer zone waters. Guard posts and firearms are to be withdrawn from the Joint Security Area (JSA) on both sides as of Oct. 25.

National Assembly in dispute over constitutionality of Moon’s ratification of Pyongyang Declaration,2018-10-25 15:14,North Korea,Lee Jeong-hun,"After South Korean President Moon Jae-in ratified the Pyongyang Joint Declaration and the Agreement on the Implementation of the Historic Panmunjom Declaration in the Military Domain (also called the Comprehensive Military Agreement, or CMA) during a Blue House cabinet meeting on Oct. 23, a dispute has erupted over the constitutionality of this action.

The Liberty Korea Party claimed that it was unconstitutional to ratify those agreements without the consent of the National Assembly and promised to take legal action, including asking the Constitutional Court to adjudicate authority on the matter and requesting an injunction suspending the ratification’s legal force. The Blue House fired back that the very act of calling this unconstitutional is unconstitutional.

Article 60, Clause 1, of the South Korean Constitution states that “The National Assembly shall have the right to consent to the conclusion and ratification of treaties pertaining to mutual assistance or mutual security; [. . .] treaties which will burden the State or people with an important financial obligation; or treaties related to legislative matters.”

The Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative opposition, contends that the CMA, which would establish a maritime buffer zone and suspend air reconnaissance activity, counts as a “treaty pertaining to [. . .] security” and that therefore it requires the consent of the National Assembly.

“The question of whether to consent to the ratification of grave matters related to the state’s foreign policy and security is something that must be judged carefully through debate in the National Assembly,” said Liberty Korea Party Floor Leader Kim Sung-tae during a press conference held at the National Assembly on Oct. 24.

Kim also argued that it “it’s not correct in terms of jurisprudence” to ratify the Pyongyang Declaration and the CMA when the Apr. 27 Panmunjom Declaration, which came first, has yet to be ratified by the National Assembly. “This is tantamount to creating the enforcement decree before the actual law has been framed, or to reporting a birth before the baby has been delivered,” he said.



The Blue House countered that “under the South Korean legal system, North Korea is not a state, and therefore any agreements made with the North or promises made to it are not treaties. The Constitution is not applicable here.”

“The treaties mentioned in Article 60 of the Constitution refer to documentary agreements between different states,” Blue House Spokesperson Kim Eui-kyum said during a meeting with reporters on Wednesday, explaining that the inter-Korean agreements do not fall under the scope of the “treaties” that must receive the approval of the National Assembly. In the Development of Inter-Korean Relations Act, inter-Korean relations are defined not as a relationship between states but as a special relationship tentatively formed during the process of moving toward unification.

“Considering that South Korea’s Constitutional Court and Supreme Court have stated categorically that previously concluded inter-Korean agreements are not subject to the Constitution, the assertion that the ratification of the Comprehensive Military Agreement is unconstitutional is a clear violation of the Constitutional Court’s decision and Supreme Court precedent,” Kim said.

“On a more fundamental level, calling this unconstitutional constitutes an undeniable acknowledgment of North Korea as a state. That contradicts Article 3 of the Constitution, which states that ‘The territory of the Republic of Korea shall consist of the Korean peninsula and its adjacent islands.’ The very argument that this is unconstitutional is in fact unconstitutional.”

South and North Korea agree to modernize tree nurseries and exterminate pinewood pest in North,2018-10-25 15:11,North Korea,Kim Ji-eun,"After an agreement was reached during a meeting of the inter-Korean forestry cooperation subcommittee on Oct. 22 to work toward modernizing 10 tree nurseries in North Korea within the year and exterminating the pinewood nematode in North Korea by March of next year, the next question concerns the current state of forests in North Korea.

There’s widespread awareness of the severe deforestation in North Korea, a country in which mountains cover 80 percent of the land, but there aren’t any officially recognized figures on this issue. A report about prospects for environmental climate change in North Korea that was published in 2012 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) based on data received from North Korea’s Ministry of Land and Environmental Protection stated that there were 8,927,300 ha (hectares) of forest land in North Korea as of 2005. The North says that 1,284,100 ha of this, or 14 percent, is deforested.

This is sharply contradicted by figures released in 2008 by South Korea’s National Institute of Forest Science, under the Korea Forest Service. The institute’s latest figures (2008), which are released every 10 years after analyzing satellite imagery, estimated that were 2.84 million ha of deforested land in North Korea. This represented a 74 percent increase from the 1.63 ha reported in the previous survey (1999). The implication is that 32 percent of North Korea’s total forested area, or 47 times the area of Seoul, is deforested. But both of these are estimates, which is the reason that experts say that joint surveys and research are critical for inter-Korean forestry cooperation.

North Korea’s deforestation is believed to have been exacerbated by the combination of famine, energy crisis and economic recession that hit the country in the 1990s amid natural disasters and the splintering of the socialist bloc. The deforestation was the consequence of chopping down too many trees, both to collect firewood for fuel and to clear land for farming.

North Korea has made an effort to restore its forests – passing forestry legislation in 1992, establishing the Ministry of Land and Environmental Protection in 1996 and establishing a 10-year plan (2001-2010) for creating forestry resources in 2000, and current leader Kim Jong-un has taken an even greater interest in this area.



It’s thought that Kim Song-jun, deputy director of the General Forestry Bureau at North Korea’s Ministry of Land and Environmental Protection, may have expressed some dissatisfaction on this point during the meeting of the inter-Korean forestry cooperation subcommittee on Oct. 22. In the words of Park Jong-ho, deputy director of the Korea Forest Service, the agreements reached during the meeting (modernizing 10 nurseries in North Korea within the year, providing pesticides for the pine wood nematode in November, working together to exterminate the pest by March 2019 and carrying out pest extermination efforts on a seasonal and yearly basis) “failed to meet the expectations” of North Korea, which is “waging a war to restore its forests.”

“My understanding is that North Korea has a substantial amount of technological capability. They probably have a strong demand for the resources and materials that they lack,” said Woo Jong-su, director of Green One Korea.

The specific areas of support that South and North Korea announced after their meeting had to do with cooperation in the production of forestry equipment and materials, including transparent panels for greenhouses and containers for nurseries. Considering that nursery modernization requires greenhouses, growth environment control systems (automatic temperature control apparatus), irrigation and shading facilities, low-temperature sapling storage facilities, and seed planting equipment, only the most basic of these materials appear to have been brought up during the meeting.

“The issue of the budget probably kept the two sides from discussing large-scale facility support in the short term,” said an expert who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Separately from this, the budget proposal for inter-Korean forestry cooperation that the Korea Forest Service submitted to the office of Democratic Party lawmaker Rep. Kim Hyeon-gwon shows that the agency is planning to invest 7.5 billion won (US$6.6 million) to build a tree nursery on state-owned land in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, with the aim of helping North Korea.

N. Korea and US have yet to determine date and location of high-level talks,2018-10-24 16:37,North Korea,Hwang Joon-bum,"North Korea and the US have yet to set a date and venue for their planned high-level talks, with White House National Security Advisor John Bolton saying a second summit between the two sides will probably take place after Jan. 1 of next year.

Meeting with journalists in Washington, DC, on Oct. 23, a senior South Korean government official said, “North Korea and the US appear to be continuing with their discussions on high-level talks.”

“Our understanding is that they have not yet set a date, and the venue has not been decided either,” the official added.

“The US is prepared to hold high-level talks, but North Korea has not yet given a concrete response,” the official said.

During an interview with Voice of America in Mexico City on Oct. 19, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ”I’m very hopeful we’ll have senior leader meetings here in the next week and a half or so between myself and my counterpart.”

An official in the South Korean government said that Pompeo was referring to the US when he said ‘here.’”

According to this official, the working level talks between US Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun and North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hee “will definitely be held because the instructions were given by the two countries’ leaders.” In regard to the relationship between the working-level talks and the high-level talks, this official said that “the two meetings will be held to complement each other without taking place in any given order.”

Addressing speculation that North Korea might be represented in the high-level talks by Kim Yo-jong, first vice director of the central committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, this official said, “I don’t think that has been confirmed by the US, either. Considering that Kim Yo-jong has attended many important meetings recently and that there is precedent for members of the [Kim] family taking on such jobs because of the unique nature of the North Korean regime, she could play that role, but I’m not sure whether she’s currently getting ready to leave North Korea.”

When asked about the delay in the confirmation for North Korea and the US’ working-level talks and high-level talks, this official said, “Considering the big game that’s being played alongside the decision to denuclearization, North Korea is also forced to be cautious about each and every step it takes. For the North, this is a game where it stands to lose all the nuclear weapons and facilities it has developed thus far at the very end of the negotiations. The North is going to thoroughly prepare for any moves it makes. That’s why I think this is taking a little longer [than expected].”

Responding to a question about whether the US government has confirmed that the second North Korea-US summit would be held next year, this official said, “People in the US government appear to be basically thinking the summit will take place around that time. Given the midterm elections at the beginning of next month [Nov. 6] and the process of preparing for the summit, that would appear to be the appropriate time frame.”

Even so, this official thinks it is possible for the Korean War to be formally ended and for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to pay a return visit to Seoul within the year, according to the plan announced by the South Korean government. In regard to the timing of the end-of-war declaration,” the official said, “The US has described the end-of-war declaration as part of the big picture, and that’s something to be negotiated. Depending on how detailed an agreement is reached during the North Korea-US working-level negotiations, I don’t think it’s impossible for the end-of-war declaration to be made within the year.”



And as for whether Kim Jong-un could pay a reciprocal visit within the year without progress in North Korea-US denuclearization negotiations, the official said, “There could be some degree of progress toward denuclearization during the working-level negotiations, and I think that process could set the stage for the leaders of South and North Korea to meet in Seoul.”

When asked whether it would be possible for Kim to make a visit within the year even if the North Korea-US negotiations remained at an impasse, the official said, “In such a situation, I figure that the leaders of South and North Korea could meet to try to make a difference.” These remarks suggest that a fourth inter-Korean summit this year could create momentum for North Korea-US negotiations.

In related news, Lee Do-hoon, South Korea’s special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, embarked on his journey home on Tuesday after discussing the North Korea-US negotiations and other matters during meetings with Biegun and other American officials in charge of Korean Peninsula policy from Oct. 21 to 23.

“Stephen and I agreed to meet together frequently and informally. Our discussion mainly revolved around how to tie together the second North Korea-US summit, the North Korea-US follow-up negotiations, steps toward denuclearization and corresponding measures and how to rally support from members of the international community, including China and Russia,” Lee told reporters.

Moon ratifies Pyongyang Declaration and CMA in cabinet meeting,2018-10-24 16:34,North Korea,Kim Bo-hyeop,"On Oct. 23, the Blue House announced that South Korean President Moon Jae-in ratified the Pyongyang Joint Declaration and the Agreement on the Implementation of the Historic Panmunjom Declaration in the Military Domain (also called the Comprehensive Military Agreement, or CMA); both agreements were reached during the Pyongyang summit in September.

The Pyongyang Declaration will be printed in the government gazette within a few days, while the CMA is supposed to be printed after sharing the text with North Korea. From the moment the two inter-Korean summit agreements are printed in the government gazette, they will become legally binding.

During his opening remarks to the cabinet meeting held on Tuesday, Moon said, “The Pyongyang Joint Declaration and the Agreement on the Implementation of the Historic Panmunjom Declaration in the Military Domain will serve to promote and facilitate the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula by furthering inter-Korean relations and easing military tensions. They not only represent the path to protecting the lives and safety of the South Korean people but will also aid our economy by eliminating risk factors on the Korean Peninsula.”

Moon’s ratification of the two agreements on Tuesday is believed to reflect his determination to move forward as quickly as possible in doing out what can be done to develop inter-Korean relations on the South Korean government’s prerogative amid the continuing sanctions on North Korea by the US and the international community.

When asked about the Blue House’s decision to ratify the Pyongyang Declaration while the motion to ratify the preceding Apr. 27 Panmunjom Declaration is still pending in the National Assembly, Blue House spokesperson Kim Eui-kyum said, “This [declaration] does not fall under the regulations of the North Korean Relations Development Act, which state that the National Assembly’s approval must be sought when a fiscal burden or legislation are necessary.”

“Even while the motion to ratify the agreement from the inter-Korean prime ministers’ meeting was still pending in the National Assembly in 2007, subsequent agreements reached by the two sides’ defense ministers, the Inter-Korean Joint Committee for Economic Cooperation and the Committee for Promoting Peaceful Cooperation in the West Sea were ratified after being approved in a cabinet meeting,” Kim explained.

The government’s explanation is that, since it believes conservative opposition parties are refusing to ratify the Panmunjom Declaration for “political reasons,” the government has no choice but to ratify the Pyongyang Declaration and the CMA in order to promote North Korea’s denuclearization and the development of inter-Korean relations.



But there is likely to be continuing procedural controversy about Moon’s ratification of the Pyongyang Declaration before the preceding Panmunjom Declaration.

“The fact that President Moon says the Panmunjom Declaration needs the approval of the National Assembly and that the Pyongyang Declaration and the Comprehensive Military Agreement don’t need its approval even though they represent the gist of the Panmunjom Declaration is evidence of his habitual high-handed abuse of power,” Liberty Korea Party Floor Leader Kim Sung-tae said during a meeting with reporters on Tuesday.

“It’s bizarre for the Comprehensive Military Agreement to be ratified while the Panmunjom Declaration has yet to be ratified by the National Assembly, considering that the former is effectively the child of the latter. In order to follow the correct order, [President Moon] should either wait until the Panmunjom Declaration has been ratified by the National Assembly or first withdraw the motion to ratify [the Panmunjom Declaration], if it in fact doesn’t require [the National Assembly’s] ratification as the Bareunmirae Party argues, and ratify that before ratifying the Comprehensive Military Agreement,” said Kim Gwan-yeong, floor leader of the Bareunmirae Party, during a telephone call with the Hankyoreh on Tuesday.

Experts on inter-Korean relations and foreign policy offered conflicting views. “The president’s ratification of the Pyongyang Joint Declaration presumes that the Panmunjom Declaration has received the approval and ratification of the National Assembly. If the Panmunjom Declaration fails to receive the National Assembly’s approval, it will also be impractical to move forward with [the Pyongyang Joint Declaration],” one expert said.

According to this interpretation, if the National Assembly votes down the motion to ratify the Panmunjom Declaration, the government would only be able to implement those sections of the Pyongyang Joint Declaration that are unrelated to the content of the Panmunjom Declaration.

Another expert offered an alternative viewpoint: “Under normal circumstances, the problem is caused when the government refuses to submit agreements to the National Assembly for ratification, but in this case [the Panmunjom Declaration], the problem is that the government has sought ratification in the National Assembly but [the opposition parties] are refusing to do so.”

[Photo] S. Korea negotiating for Kaesong complex business owners to visit North Korea,2018-10-24 16:27,North Korea,,"The South Korean Ministry of Unification announced on Oct. 24 that its currently negotiating a visit to North Korea by business owners with investments in the Kaesong Industrial Complex. During a press briefing in Seoul, Unification Minister Spokesperson Baek Tae-hyun said the government is negotiating with North Korean authorities to allow entrepreneurs with investments in the Kaesong Industrial Complex to inspects their assets in North Korea. Although negotiations are still underway, it is expected that the visit will occur sometime next week. The business owners have been isolated from their assets since the Park Geun-hye administration shut down the complex in February 2016.

"N. Korea and US narrow down potential summit sites to “3 or 4 places,” Blue House official says",2018-10-23 18:24,North Korea,Seong Yeon-cheol,"North Korea and the US are “talking about three or four places” as possible venues for a second summit, a senior Blue House official said on Oct. 21.

The official, who accompanied South Korean President Moon Jae-in on his recent European tour, shared the remarks with reporters soon after their return.

“[US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo] reached a substantial agreement [with the North] during his fourth North Korea, so the time has come to meet,” the official said.

While visiting Mexico City on Oct. 19, Pompeo said, “I'm very hopeful we'll have senior leader meetings here in the next week and a half or so between myself and my [North Korean] counterpart.”

The same official also responded to claims from some corners that President Moon could trouble the US with remarks during his European tour in which he publicly mentioned the need to reduce US sanctions against the North as it achieves substantive denuclearization.

“On the contrary, we are helping the US out,” the official said.

“That’s not what the South Korea-US alliance is about,” the official continued.

“There may be different views even within the US, and while it may be a bit different [from South Korea] in procedural terms, our direction and goals are the same, so the US trusts us.”

“The way we get there may be a bit different, but we are ultimately walking the same path,” the official said. When asked when the loosening of sanctions might occur, the official replied, “We’ll have to wait and see.”

The official also noted the recent rapid progress and development in inter-Korean relations.

“The rate of progression [in inter-Korean relations] has truly been tremendous. Honestly, it’s almost strange how quickly it’s progressed,” the official said.

“I believe a South Korea visit by Chairman Kim Jong-un within the year is still a possibility,” the official continued.

The official also said President Moon holds a far more positive and optimistic view of the recent situation than his advisors.

“President Moon seems confident and committed that we are moving the right direction in the broad scheme of things [in terms of the Korean Peninsula situation], even if it takes some time,” the official said.

“He’s optimistic enough that when his advisors express concern, he’s the one telling them, ‘Don’t worry.’”

At the same time, the official relayed President Moon’s concerns about reporting on the activities of Blue House National Security Office Director Chung Eui-yong due to the nature of inter-Korean relations.

“He said words to the effect that he would like the media’s support in seeing to it that people are not notified when the National Security Office director travels outside,” the official said.

“It appears that he said that because of the special nature of inter-Korean relations,” the official added.

Meanwhile, Chung was given a scrap of clothing worn by Mother Teresa by Father Han Hyun-taek, who served as interpreter for an Oct. 18 meeting with President Moon and Pope Francis.

“In presenting him with the clothing scrap, Father Han told him, ‘Good things will happen if you carry this around with you,’” the official said.

The official also reported that President Moon’s “stock” had risen enough that he received meeting requests from 15 heads of state during the ASEM Summit in Belgium.

“President Moon was very popular,” said another Blue House official.

“Among [the heads of state], we opted to meet with the UK and Germany,” the official added.

Blue House paying close attention to US reports on scheduling of 2nd summit with N. Korea,2018-10-23 18:22,North Korea,Kim Bo-hyeop,"The Blue House is keeping a close eye on reports about the time and location of the second North Korea-US summit. On Oct. 22, a number of domestic and foreign news media cited a diplomatic source in Washington as saying the summit was likely to be held after the turn of the year, in early January.

If the North Korea-US summit is pushed back until next year, which would be later than originally expected, it could impact the schedule of the formal declaration of the end of the Korean War and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s reciprocal visit to Seoul, both of which Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to do during their summit in Panmunjom on Apr. 27.

For now, officials in the Blue House are determined to wait for the results of the North Korea-US high-level talks, which are being held to decide the time and location of the summit. “The reports by some US media outlets that the North Korea-US summit is being delayed until January of next year are not confirmed and are based on a quote by an anonymous source. I’ve been given to understand that North Korea and the US are currently exchanging various opinions about the summit,” a senior official at the Blue House said during a press briefing on Monday.

“We’re getting mixed signals from the Americans, so it seems a little early to conclude that the North Korea-US summit will be delayed,” another senior official said in a telephone call with the Hankyoreh.

In related news, South Korean President Moon Jae-in is planning to ratify the Pyongyang Joint Declaration and the Agreement on the Implementation of the Historic Panmunjom Declaration in the Military Domain (Comprehensive Military Agreement) during a cabinet meeting on Oct. 23.

When the Unification Ministry recently inquired with the Ministry of Government Legislation as to whether the National Assembly’s approval is necessary to ratify these two agreements, the Ministry of Government Legislation reportedly said it is not. The Pyongyang Joint Declaration was signed by Kim and Moon and the Comprehensive Military Agreement was signed by South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo and North Korean Minister of the People’s Armed Forces No Kwang-chol during the inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang on Sept. 19.

US continually pushes back timeline for 2nd summit with North Korea,2018-10-23 18:20,North Korea,Hwang Joon-bum,"September 24: “The date and time will be announced shortly.”
October 7: “The summit will be held as quickly as possible.”
October 9: “It will be held after the midterm elections.”
October 12: “It will be held sometime in the next two to three months.”
October 19: “It looks like it will be happening after Jan. 1.”

The US timeline for holding a second summit with North Korea keeps getting pushed back. After it initially seemed that the summit would happen soon after an inter-Korean summit on Sept. 19, over a month has passed without any decision on the date or venue. Now high-level US authorities are even talking about it taking place past Jan. 1.

After previously indicating the summit date would come “after the midterms,” US President Donald Trump, is now openly calling not to “rush” things. His remarks appear to support White House National Security Advisor John Bolton and others who are setting a later date for the meeting.

“What this shows is that the North Korea-US summit schedule is essentially predicated on progress with denuclearization,” said a former diplomat familiar with North Korea-US relations.

In practical terms of the time needed to coordinate a summit agenda and make protocol and security preparations, a date within the year would be cutting things quite close. Coordinating the November and December schedules of Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un would be no easy matter either. Trump is reportedly scheduled to visit France on Nov. 11 for an event marking the centennial of the First World War’s end and to attend the G20 summit in Argentina on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1. Kim is preparing a big schedule of his own, including his visit to Russia and a North Korea visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Some analysts have suggested Washington is using the timeline as leverage to pressure Pyongyang into additional denuclearization steps – suggesting that North Korea could help hasten things by making progress with denuclearization.

“With the midterm elections coming up, the Trump administration seems to want to send the message back home that it is not going to beg North Korea for dialogue, while sending Pyongyang the signal that it is pressing for more advanced denuclearization measures,” said University of North Korean Studies professor Yang Moo-jin.
“With this battle of wits still going between North Korea and the US, it’s tough to conclude yet whether the summit will be put off until next year,” Yang said.

At the same time, Washington has also been sending signals that it wants to sustain the current dialogue climate, including its proposal to hold high-level talks and its decision to suspend the Vigilant Ace joint Air Force exercise with South Korea.

“The messages the US has been sending North Korea are mixed,” said Institute for National Security Strategy senior researcher Lee Soo-hyoung.

“In addition to the dialogue signals, there has also been an emphasis on keeping sanctions in place and moves by hardliners to increase pressure on North Korea by dragging things out,” Lee said.

The mixed signals from Washington show how complex the battle of wits with Pyongyang has become. At the Sept. 19 inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang, North Korea pledged to dismantle its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, contingent on corresponding measures from the US. It then joined China and Russia in demanding a gradual loosening of sanctions.



In other words, North Korea’s target has shifted from a declaration ending the Korean War to the lifting of the sanctions against it. During his European tour, South Korean President Moon Jae-in raised the need to consider loosening sanctions at a stage of “irreversible” denuclearization by North Korea. The US, for its part, has been forced to weigh the importance of corresponding measures.

The general outline of the second North Korea-US summit schedule appears likely to be drawn at the high-level talks, which are predicted to happen as early as next week. If the North Korea-US summit date does move into next year, it could affect Kim’s plans to visit South Korea as indicated in the Sept. 19 Pyongyang Joint Declaration. Diplomatic sources predicted that the difficulties in coordinating North Korea’s denuclearization with corresponding US measures would continue, but said negotiations could gain renewed momentum once the high-level talks take place.

“At the moment, we are hoping the second North Korea-US summit proceeds smoothly, and we look forward to Chairman Kim paying a reciprocal visit to Seoul as scheduled,” said Blue House spokesperson Kim Eui-kyum in an Oct. 22 briefing.

[Photo] South and North Korea agree on joint pest control and modernization of plant nurseries,2018-10-23 18:14,North Korea,,"Talks for inter-Korean forestry cooperation were held at the inter-Korean joint liaison office in the Kaesong Industrial Complex on Oct. 22. The South Korean delegation was headed by Korea Forest Service Deputy Director Park Jong-ho, the North Korean delegation by Ministry of Land and Environmental Protection General Forestry Bureau Deputy Director Kim Song-jun. In the spirit of implementing the agreements stipulated in the September Pyongyang Joint Declaration, both sides agreed to a joint pest control project until March of next year. They also agreed to modernize ten plant nurseries in North Korea by the end of the year. (photo pool)"
"[Interview] “North Korea also has attorneys, prosecutors and courts”",2018-10-22 17:23,North Korea,Kim Nam-il,"“Even” North Korea has lawyers. Its Socialist Constitution states that “courts cases are heard in public and the accused is guaranteed the right of defense.” In 1993, it created an Attorney Act with 30 articles. It also has a bar association, its equivalent to the South’s Korea Bar Association.

But there is a difference in terms of the attorney’s role. Article 1 of the North Korean Attorney Act states that attorneys are to “contribute to protecting the legal rights and interests of institutions, companies, groups, and citizens and guaranteeing the correct enforcement of the law.”

This stands in contrast with the South Korean Attorney-at-Law Act, which states that the “mission of an attorney-at-law shall be to defend fundamental human rights and realize [. . . ] social justice.”

“I don’t really know the situation with the legal community. I’m sure they have a legal community there. All we really have access to are the North Korean Constitution and laws; there aren’t any exchanges among legal professionals. So we have to meet.”

Former Supreme Court Justice Lee Hong-hoon, 72, welcomes recent developments in inter-Korean relations, which may be slow in coming but are not as susceptible to being pushed back as they have been in the past. After stepping down from the Supreme Court in 2011, Lee launched a public interest committee for the law firm Yoon & Yang the following year; in 2014, he became inaugural chairman of the Yoon & Yang Public Interest Foundation.

After stepping down to the position of advisory attorney for the foundation last December, he became chairman in January for the Judicial Development Committee with the People, where he has been developing a framework for judicial reforms. While this was going on, something else happened: the May launch of the Peace Community Legislation Forum, designed to provide legal support for inter-Korean exchange and cooperation. Lee, who serves as a representative for the forum, met with the Hankyoreh on Oct. 1 in the Yoon & Yang Public Interest Foundation’s conference room at ASEM Tower in Seoul’s Gangnam District.

“In December of last year, before the April inter-Korean summit, legal professionals and private groups met and agreed to contribute to establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula and integrating the community through inter-Korean legal exchange and cooperation. I also presented a proposed full amendment there to the Inter-Korean Exchange and Cooperation Act.”

Lee truly sensed the need for “peace community legislation” when the Kaesong Industrial Complex was closed in Feb. 2016.



“Before discussing political unification, we need to focus on the value of peace and integrating communities. Discussions of unification that do not include enough of a social consensus on that value are meaningless, and sometimes dangerous. If our aim is achieve a stable, lasting peace regime instead of temporary peace, it is essential that we create laws and institutions to unite the settings where exchange and cooperation happen.”

During his time as a judge, Lee produced a number of forward-thinking rulings on cases involving violations of the National Security Act and other issues. It is because of this experience that he understands better than anyone how difficult it can be to achieve a social consensus on qualitative changes to inter-Korean relations.

“That’s why getting the conversation started through inter-Korean exchange is the most important thing. North Korea also has attorneys, prosecutors, and courts. Kim Il-Sung University has a law department. When it comes to dialogue, it matters who you’re talking to, but everyone is in the dark about the North Korean situation.”



Despite the lack of understanding, Lee was not going to simply sit around in frustration. Among the participants in the Legislation Forum are private groups with previous experience in exchange and cooperation, along with the South Korean office of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation based in Germany – which has its own previous experience with reunification.

“The experience and vision of people who have been working on the front lines in inter-Korean exchange and cooperation are invaluable assets in establishing a legal system to support peace and community. Germany’s reunification process remains a vital reference for us.”

Stefan Samse, a jurist who serves as director of the Adenauer Foundation’s Korea office, recently paid two visits to North Korea.

“He said he met with representatives of North Korean courts, and then with Kim Il-sung University. I look forward to opportunities for South and North Korean legal professionals and scholars to meet and exchange opinions. Seminars could be held in North Korea, South Korea, or a third country.”

Many legal professionals have long been involved in research with an interest in North Korean laws, unification-related laws, laws on inter-Korean exchange and cooperation, and North Korean human rights. It remains difficult to find similarities between the South and North Korean legal systems to match their differences.

“North Korea’s legal system will have to change if it wants to pursue economic cooperation with the international community going ahead. Our forum can provide support with that,” Lee said.



Lee appeared to be giving a lot of thought to areas where South and North Korean laws are in conflict.

“You can’t simply force one side’s system and laws and the other – but there is a way,” he said. “Just as South and North put their heads together to come up with regulations when they first operated the Kaesong Complex, the two sides need to meet first to discuss the problems that could surface in the exchange and cooperation process.”

One idea that Lee is considering involves creating a legal journal for inter-Korean relations to share and discuss North Korean law-related articles.

The forum is currently preparing a roundtable discussion on economic sanctions and legal issues in the economic areas where exchange and cooperation will be concentrated.

“It’s dangerous to view the North as something to exploit. With economic cooperation, you can only build a real relationship of trust when you proceed together as equal partners.”

Lee is also working on changing the forum into a corporation.

“In the past, the hard-won trust between South and North Korea has often collapsed due to changes in policies as new administrations have come into office and changes in the international environment. To overcome this kind of instability, the forum wants to revise the laws and systems to place inter-Korean agreements on a solid footing and increase predictability.”

Some of the young public interest attorneys lending their support include Ham Bo-hyeon and Hong Yu-jin of the Yoon & Yang Public Interest Foundation, Song Yoon-jeong of Barun Law, and Kim Gwang-hoon of the DongIn Law Group.

Forestry cooperation meeting held on Oct. 22 at inter-Korean joint liaison office,2018-10-22 17:17,North Korea,Lee Je-hun,"Forestry cooperation subcommittee talks took place on Oct. 22 at the inter-Korean joint liaison office in the Kaesong Industrial Complex as agreed upon in high-level inter-Korean talks on Oct. 15.

The senior representatives to the talks were Korea Forest Service Deputy Director Park Jong-ho on the South Korean side and Ministry of Land and Environmental Protection General Forestry Bureau Deputy Director Kim Song-jun on the North Korean side, the South Korean Ministry of Unification announced on Oct. 21.

Priority discussions reportedly focused on joint pest control efforts in border regions including Mt. Keumgang and modernization of North Korean tree nurseries – part of an effort to “achieve substantial results in forestry cooperation” as stressed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in their Pyongyang Joint Declaration in September.

Military authorities are also moving to accelerate the process for implementing the Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA) according to the Panmunjom Declaration. The second round of trilateral talks involving South and North Korea and the UN Command were held on Oct. 22 at the House of Peace in Panmunjom. The second meeting took place only five days after the first.

The Ministry of National Defense has also announced that inter-Korean general-level military talks will be held at Unification House (Tongilgak) in Panmunjom on Oct. 26.



While the dates have not yet been announced, public health/healthcare subcommittee talks and athletic talks are also scheduled to take place at the Kaesong liaison office within the month.

During this week or the beginning or middle of next week at the latest, the two sides are further expected to begin a joint local examination of the Gyeongui (Seoul-Sinuiju) railway line (West Sea line), which they had initially planned to carry out on Aug. 22 before being blocked by the UN Command. In their high-level talks on Oct. 15, the two sides said they would be “beginning a joint examination of the Gyeongui line in late October,” while Blue House Spokesperson Kim Eui-kyum said on Oct. 18 that Seoul was “cooperating closely with the US” on the railway cooperation issue and expecting a “positive result.”

A South Korean government official predicted there will “not be any setbacks in the schedule South and North agreed upon.”

Indeed, the two sides have been exchanging telephone messages since the high-level talks to coordinate the schedule for the Gyeongui line survey. Sources familiar with the situation said the main issues in current inter-Korean discussions concern the survey’s schedule and start date rather than its methods. In terms of methods, the joint survey approach agreed upon in August is to be applied: a South Korean train consisting of a locomotive and six passenger and freight cars (including a conference room, sleeping car, dining car, fuel car, and water) is to depart Seoul Station and cross the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), at which point the locomotive is to be replaced with a North Korean one and North Korean officials will join the train’s journey to Sinuiju via Kaesong and Pyongyang.

But with the South insisting on a period of around ten days for the survey and North Korea maintaining it could done in six days, the two sides are expected to settle on a schedule somewhere in between.

Pompeo signals he wants N. Korean counterpart to travel to US for high-level meetings,2018-10-22 17:16,North Korea,Lee Je-hun,"If the North Korea-US high-level talks that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said might take place within “the next week and a half” actually occur, who would be his North Korean negotiating counterpart?

During an interview with Voice of America in Mexico City, Pompeo said, ”I’m very hopeful we’ll have senior leader meetings here in the next week and a half or so between myself and my counterpart.”

While Pompeo did not specify the location, his remarks show that he wants his North Korean negotiating counterpart to come to the US for the meeting, rather than him making a fifth trip to North Korea.

In light of Pompeo’s past negotiations with North Korea, the first figure that comes to mind is Kim Yong-chol, the vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK). On June 1, Kim Yong-chol traveled to the US as a special envoy from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and visited the White House, where he delivered a personal letter from Kim Jong-un to US President Donald Trump. Kim Yong-chol was also Pompeo’s negotiating counterpart during his first three visits to North Korea (Mar. 31-Apr. 1, May 8-9 and July 6-7).

But the upcoming meeting could mark a break with precedent. During Pompeo’s fourth visit to North Korea on Oct. 7, Kim Jong-un dealt with him directly. On top of that, the person who accompanied Kim Jong-un during his meeting with Pompeo was not Kim Yong-chol but rather Kim Yo-jong, first vice director of the WPK central committee. Kim Yong-chol only attended the luncheon.

This is prompting speculation about Kim Yo-jong visiting the US if the North Korea-US high-level talks are held in the US as Pompeo hopes. Even in that case, however, “Kim Yo-jong might not come alone,” according a senior South Korean official handling foreign policy and security. Even if Kim Yo-jong visits the US as a special envoy carrying a personal letter from Kim Jong-un, a tête-à-tête with Pompeo might be inappropriate under the current circumstances, leading some to think that she might be accompanied by someone else.

In such an event, her companion is less likely to be Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho than Kim Yong-chol. Ri did meet with Pompeo on Sept. 26, around the time of the UN General Assembly, but they did not negotiate, nor was Ri Pompeo’s negotiating counterpart during his four trips to North Korea.

US calls for high-level meeting at end of Oct. to prepare for 2nd N. Korea-US summit,2018-10-22 17:14,North Korea,Hwang Joon-bum,"As North Korea and the US continue their tug-of-war over what should come first --denuclearization by the North or corresponding measures by the US -- leading up to their second summit, the US is trying to engineer a breakthrough by calling for a high-level meeting at the end of October.

The next issue is whether the high-level meeting will help the two sides break out of their bottleneck and bring about a preliminary agreement that will quickly lead to a second summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump.

“We’re working on finding dates and times and places [for the summit] that will work for each of the two leaders [President Trump and Chairman Kim]. I’m very hopeful we’ll have senior leader meetings here in the next week and a half or so between myself and my counterpart to continue this discussion so that when the two of them get together there’s real opportunity to make another big step forward on denuclearization,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during an interview with Voice of America on Oct. 19.

The mention of “the next week and a half” means that high-level North Korea-US talks could be held at the end of this month. Considering that the working-level meeting between US Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun and North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hee has not been held, it’s uncertain whether Pompeo’s reference to “senior leader meetings” means that the working-level meeting would be held first or that he would move forward with a high-level meeting. At any rate, a high-level meeting is likely to provide a critical opportunity to reach a compromise on the debate over denuclearization and corresponding measures prior to the summit.

During Pompeo’s fourth trip to North Korea on Oct. 7, the US reportedly asked the North to take more steps, such as disclosing a list of its nuclear weapons and facilities, in addition to the closure of its nuclear facilities in Punggye Village, Dongchang Village and Yongbyon. This reportedly elicited strong pushback from the North and a demand for the US to take corresponding measures, such as formally ending the Korean War and easing sanctions.

The central challenge of the North Korea-US negotiations is to create an action plan while balancing each other’s demands. In connection with this, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said during his summit with Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen on Oct. 20 that “Making a timetable for the denuclearization process and the US’ corresponding measures will be the agenda of the second North Korea-US summit.”

“The reason that Choe Son-hee and Stephen Biegun haven’t held working-level talks yet is because North Korea and the US haven’t reached an agreement on their list of demands [about denuclearization and corresponding measures]. Pompeo proposed meeting with the North Koreans because the North and the US have arranged an agenda through backroom negotiations and the US has fixed its position about easing sanctions,” said Cho Sung-ryul, senior research fellow for the Institute for National Security Strategy.

If the framework of the agenda for the second North Korea-US summit is put in place during the high-level talks, it will be possible for Biegun and Choe to launch their negotiations about the list of concessions the two sides will swap in regard to the initial steps toward denuclearization and corresponding measures.




The timing and location of the summit is also likely to be up for discussion during the high-level talks. North Korea reportedly hopes to hold the summit in Pyongyang as soon as possible, while the US reportedly prefers holding the summit in a third country such as Switzerland or Sweden while it waits for North Korea to take additional steps toward denuclearization. It is also possible that Biegun and Choe will be introduced to each other during the high-level talks.

The announcement by South Korea and top US military officials on Oct. 19 that they will suspend this year’s Vigilant Ace Air Force exercise, which is normally held each December, is also expected to help boost the mood for dialogue between North Korea and the US.

There’s also expected to be coordination between South Korea and the US in preparation for the North Korea-US negotiations. On Oct. 21, Lee Do-hoon, South Korea’s special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, departed the country to coordinate the two countries’ policy on North Korea. Lee is scheduled to deliberate upcoming North Korea-US negotiations, including their second summit, during meetings with Biegun and other officials in Washington through Oct. 23.

“This seems to be a question of when they’ll set the time. I think we’re past the stage of asking whether or not it will happen,” Lee said in regard to Biegun and Choe’s working-level meeting.



At the same time, the US is sending signals that it won’t rush the second North Korea-US summit. An anonymous official in the US government told reporters on Oct. 19 that the second summit was likely to take place early next year. During a rally for the midterm elections on Oct. 20, Trump said that North Korean affairs would turn out well but said he wouldn’t try to rush them. Trump appears to be attempting to seize the initiative by stating that he won’t be pressed for time in his negotiations with North Korea.

If the second North Korea-US summit is pushed back to next year, it will make it harder to implement agreements reached by the leaders of South and North Korea, including making an end-of-war declaration and Kim Jong-un paying a return visit to Seoul before the end of the year. That shows how important the North Korea-US high-level talks are.

Mine removal operation in Panmunjom’s JSA completed,2018-10-20 16:07,North Korea,Park Byong-su,"The operation to clear mines from the Joint Security Area (JSA) at Panmunjom has effectively been completed. Next week, the two sides are expected to begin removing troops from guard posts (GPs).

“The clearing of mines, which is the first step toward demilitarizing the JSA, has basically ended. We’re told that the North Koreans are also in the final stages,” a South Korean military official said on Oct. 19. In a military agreement reached last month, South and North Korea said they would remove all mines from the JSA by Oct. 20. During the mine removal work that has continued since Oct. 1, North Korea has apparently removed five mines, while South Korea has not turned up any mines.

Since the mine clearing operations have gone smoothly, South and North Korea, along with the UN Command, are planning to immediately begin removing GPs, troops and firearms from the JSA. According to the military agreement, which South and North Korea signed on Sept. 19, all the GPs, staff and firearms on both sides are supposed to be removed five days after the mines have been cleared.

North Korea currently has five GPs inside the JSA, while South Korea has four. After all the posts are gone, the two sides will set up alternating GPs at the northern and southern entrances to the JSA. South Koreans will install a GP at the end of Panmunjom Bridge, at the northern entrance, while North Koreans will install one at the southern entrance. All the weaponry in the possession of South and North Korean troops – including machine guns, AK-47 rifles, K-2 rifles and handguns – will be removed from the JSA.

In a press release issued on Friday, the UN Command said it had verified the mine removal work that had taken place thus far at Panmunjom as part of the Agreement on the Implementation of the Historic Panmunjom Declaration in the Military Domain (also called the Comprehensive Military Agreement, or CMA) in close cooperation with the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff and that it supported the next practical steps that South and North Korea would take to implement the military agreement.

“Yesterday's UN Command verification of initial mine clearance operations in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) lays the foundation for future progress on the CMA [Comprehensive Military Agreement] implementation,” said Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of the UN Command.

Brooks added that the UN Command would deliberate closely with South and North Korea to work on implementing the other terms of the agreement.

Moon asks ASEM member states for support to peace on Korean Peninsula,2018-10-20 16:05,North Korea,Seong Yeon-cheol,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who visited Belgium to attend the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), said on Oct. 19 that “peace on the Korean Peninsula will lead to the co-prosperity of Asia and Europe” and asked ASEM member states to lend their support to peace on the Korean Peninsula.

“During my three meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, I have confirmed his commitment to denuclearization and to peace on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea and the US have also ended their 70-year hostile relationship and are sitting down together to discuss peace,” Moon said during general remarks in the ASEM summit, which was held in Brussels on Friday.

“South Korea is actively pursuing a New Southern Policy that aims to link ASEAN and India on the ocean and a New Northern Policy that seeks to create a continental connection to Europe. I believe that the link between Asia and Europe will be completed through peace on the Korean Peninsula,” Moon said. While emphasizing that peace on the Korean Peninsula, rather than being irrelevant to the ASEM member states, is linked to their joint development, Moon asked for their interest and support.

“We need to establish an open and predictable trade order and ensure that the foundation of the system of free trade is not undermined. While ASEM leads the discussion about the people-centered Fourth Industrial Revolution, we must not allow other forms of inequality to arise, such as the polarization of jobs or the widening of the digital divide,” Moon said during his speech.

In meetings with the leaders of the UK, Germany and the EU prior to the ASEM summit, Moon spoke of the need to ease the international community’s sanctions on the North as progress is made on the North’s denuclearization and took steps to promote public discussion of this idea.

During Moon’s summit with Prime Minister Theresa May of the UK (who has a say over lifting sanctions on North Korea as the head of government of a permanent member of the UN Security Council), Moon reportedly made his case for the international community easing sanctions on the North when real progress is made toward the North’s denuclearization. Moon expressed his willingness to seriously consider easing sanctions on the North even before its complete denuclearization during an interview with the BBC prior to his tour of Europe.

The South Korea-UK summit took place at Moon’s request. May said she would not waver in supporting peace on the Korean Peninsula. During summits with the leaders of France and Italy, Moon repeated his view that “once North Korea’s steps toward denuclearization are believed to have reached an irreversible state, UN sanctions should be relaxed to promote denuclearization.”

Afterward, Moon also had a summit with German Prime Minister Angela Merkel.

“The Berlin Initiative served as the beginning of the recent positive changes on the Korean Peninsula,” Moon said gratefully, referring to a speech in July 2017 during which he asked North Korea to participate in the Pyongyang Winter Olympics and expressed his willingness to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

“During this tour of Europe, Moon has been explaining in detail the changing mood on the Korean Peninsula and asking the states of Europe for their understanding and cooperation,” said a senior official at the Blue House. Moon called for protection of the multilateral trade order, inclusive growth and a joint response to climate change and protection of the environment.

Moon says giving speech at St. Peter’s Basilica was “like a dream”,2018-10-19 14:52,North Korea,Seong Yeon-cheol,"“Panmunjom will now become a symbol of peace on the Korean Peninsula,” said South Korean President Moon Jae-in during his official visit to the Vatican on Oct. 17. Moon said it felt “like a dream” to deliver a speech in St. Peter’s Basilica.

After completing a “special mass for peace on the Korean Peninsula” at St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican City on Wednesday, Moon had dinner at the residence of the South Korean ambassador to the Vatican with Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, who had officiated the mass. During the two-hour dinner, Moon said that “it felt like a dream to attend mass and then speak at St. Peter’s Basilica,” according to Senior Secretary to the President for Public Relations Yoon Young-chan.

“There’s a Korean proverb that says that if you’re sincere enough, you can move the heavens. I’ve got this feeling that peace will really be achieved on the Korean Peninsula,” Moon said.

“Because of the Pyongyang Joint Declaration, we’re working on clearing mines and removing soldiers and weapons from the area around Panmunjom. Panmunjom will now become a symbol of peace on the Korean Peninsula.”

“I too think the Lord will have to answer our prayers. Our prayers have been truly intense, and I believe the Lord has heard them,” Parolin said in response.

Parolin offered Moon words of encouragement. “You took a big step when you met the North Korean leader, Your Excellency, and I think that things are going to keep going well in the future.”

“I had an eye on the crowd during your speech, Your Excellency, and all the believers seemed to be hanging on your every word. It wasn’t just another speech; they all seemed to be convinced of what you were saying.”

Parolin personally officiated over the mass for peace on the Korean Peninsula that was held at St. Peter’s Basilica. At the beginning of the mass, he delivered a greeting in Korean: “I would like to welcome Their Excellencies President Moon Jae-in and first lady Kim Jung-sook. I offer the blessing of His Holiness Pope Francis. Let us pray for peace on the Korean Peninsula.”




Participants at the mass smiled in apparent delight at the cardinal’s use of the Korean language. After mass, Moon delivered a commemorative speech that lasted about 12 minutes. It is “very special and unusual” for the president of a particular country to deliver such a speech, the Vatican explained. After the speech, Moon walked down from the pulpit alongside Parolin. When Moon remarked that the mass had “conveyed an earnest desire for peace on the Korean Peninsula,” Parolin replied, “Let us continue to pray.”

“I’ve been at the Vatican for nine years now, and I’ve never seen a visiting foreign leader deliver a speech before. It’s also extremely rare for Parolin to personally officiate the mass,” said a nun who attended mass. “I feel very proud.”

According to reports, the Vatican readily accepted the South Korean proposal for Moon to deliver a speech. “During the deliberations over the itinerary [of Moon’s visit], we were the first to suggest attending a mass. When the Vatican asked what the mass’s theme should be, we proposed the theme of peace on the Korean Peninsula,” said Kwon Hyeok-u, a South Korean diplomat to the Vatican.

“When the Vatican asked what President Moon wanted to do, he said he wanted to deliver a speech. The Vatican accepted this idea, leading to the rare occurrence of a presidential speech [at St. Peter’s Basilica],” Kwon said.

Moon secures Pope’s consent for visit to North Korea,2018-10-19 14:49,North Korea,Seong Yeon-cheol,"“Don’t stop, and keep moving forward. Don’t be afraid,” said Pope Francis, speaking to a special believer named Timothy who visited him on Oct. 18.

Pope Francis was telling South Korean President Moon Jae-in, whose saint’s name is Timothy, not to stop working for peace on the Korean Peninsula. “I strongly support the South Korean government’s ongoing efforts to promote the peace process on the Korean Peninsula,” the pope said, making clear that he stands behind Moon.

Pope Francis’s staunch support for peace on the Korean Peninsula exceeded expectations. Even before the meeting, Blue House officials said they didn’t expect the pope to clearly express his willingness to visit North Korea and thought the best case scenario was that he would ‘seriously consider’ it. But the pope explicitly said he was willing to visit North Korea and would definitely respond if he received an invitation from the North. He also voiced his strong support for Moon’s plan for peace on the Korean Peninsula. For Moon, the papal response was an unexpected boon that delivered everything he had hoped and more.



Pope Francis’ immediate acceptance of the proposed papal visit to North Korea is consistent with the interest and affection he has shown for the divided Korean Peninsula. The Argentine pope has long taken an unusual interest in peace on the Korean Peninsula. In Aug. 2014, he chose South Korea for his third visit as pope, and his first to Asia, and he has prayed for the peace of the Korean Peninsula whenever Korean affairs have been at a critical juncture, including the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, the inter-Korean summit and the North Korea-US summit.

At every opportunity, Moon has also expressed his gratitude for the pope’s prayers on social media. The pope has also taken personal action on behalf of inter-Korean reconciliation, such as supporting a reconciliation event in a meeting with Protestant representatives from South and North Korea in Geneva, Switzerland, this past June. When Moon asked the pope on Oct. 18 whether Kim Jong-un could send an invitation, the pope expressed his trust in Moon as messenger by saying, “President Moon, the words you have conveyed are sufficient in themselves, but it would be nice to receive an official invitation.” When Moon conveyed Kim’s message of gratitude for the pope’s prayers for inter-Korean peace, the pope said, “In fact, it is I who am grateful,” showing that he is well-disposed to Kim.



By securing Pope Francis’ consent for a visit to North Korea, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has achieved the main goal of his tour of Europe. The Blue House had said that “the primary objective of this trip is to communicate Chairman Kim’s intention to request a papal visit.”

In a column published in L'Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of Vatican City in Rome, Moon expressed his “hope that exchange will be further promoted between the Vatican and North Korea” in a veiled request for the pope to visit the North soon. A papal visit could function as a “certified check” for a Korean Peninsula at peace, without war.

Pope Francis’ support has given Moon’s plan for peace on the Korean Peninsula a major boost. Moon’s plan is to build a peace and security regime in Northeast Asia that would play out through an end-of-war declaration within the year, the signing of a peace treaty and the dissolution of the Cold War alignment. The reason the Blue House settled on arranging a papal visit to North Korea as the primary objective of Moon’s trip to Europe is because of its belief that the support of the pope – a symbol of peace and reconciliation who leads 1.2 billion believers around the world – could help further accelerate the newly established order on the Korean Peninsula.

This also puts more weight behind Moon’s central theme during his tour of Europe that sanctions on North Korea should be eased to promote the North’s denuclearization. The pope exerts influence over the Catholic countries of Europe, including France and Italy. After his summits with the leaders of France and Italy, Moon tried to persuade them that “the international community’s sanctions on the North should be eased after denuclearization has progressed to an irreversible point,” and he is expected to make the same case to the leaders of the UK and Germany, whom he will meet during the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Belgium.

Pope’s visit to North Korea becomes plausible reality,2018-10-19 14:47,North Korea,Lee Je-hun,"“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” said Korean Christian Federation chairman Kang Myong-chol.

“Peace!” replied Pope Francis, smiling brightly.

The Pope’s meeting with a representative of the North Korean Christian community at a 70th anniversary event for the World Council of Churches (WCC) in Geneva on June 21 was arranged by figures from the South Korean religious community. It was Pope Francis’ first meeting with a North Korean since being named Pope in Mar. 2013.

The idea of the Pope visiting Pyongyang and meeting with North Korea’s 25 million people is no longer just a dream, but something that could soon be a reality. Following his declaration in an Oct. 18 meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in that he would “unquestionably answer an [official] invitation” from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and “could go” to North Korea, the questions of when and how Pope Francis might visit North Korea have become the focus of global attention.



But while the Pope’s strong commitment may have been established, many hurdles remain to be cleared for an official visit to take place. According to canon law, a formal invitation must be extended by a country’s government and Catholic church (the diocese leader for the city being visited) for the Pope to visit a specific country. If he does visit, he is to be met by the chairperson of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Korea and the bishop of the diocese in the city being visited – an unwritten rule that has established itself as a tradition.

The individual recognized by the Vatican as (acting) bishop of the Pyongyang diocese is Archbishop Andrew Yeom Soo-jung. The administrative requirements would be met with formal invitations from Kim Jong-un and Yeom as acting bishop. Under the current state of affairs, Pope Francis would have to be met by Yeom if he visits Pyongyang.

This would cause a burden for both North Korean authorities and the Vatican. Sources in the religious community said North Korea, with all its emphasis on “autonomy” and “sovereignty,” is unlikely to accept the Pope being met by the South Korean Yeom on behalf of the North Korean Catholic Church – even if the improvement in trust between the two sides after three summits this year is taken into account.



The Vatican is a similarly awkward spot. North Korea has around 3,000 people registered with authorities as Catholic, but not a single priest. As a sovereign state, the Vatican City focuses on “spreading the gospel” and “guarding world peace and human rights” in its diplomacy. It’s an approach that factors into the Vatican’s lack of diplomatic ties to North Korea or socialist China and Vietnam despite relations with 183 other countries, including South Korea.

In the case of China, which has around 8 million Catholics, the longstanding conflict over the appointment of bishops now stands to be resolved after the two sides signed a preliminary agreement on the matter on Sept. 22. Two Chinese bishops visited the Vatican on Oct. 16 to convey plans to invite the Pope for a visit. This explains the current hopeful predictions that a China visit by Pope Francis may be in the offing. China has not had diplomatic relations with the Vatican since severing them in 1951.

Vietnam’s 6 million Catholics represent the second-highest number in Southeast Asia after the Philippines, and the country has a cardinal appointed by the Pope. Yet the Pope himself has never visited, and diplomatic ties have not been established despite long efforts by the Vietnamese government.




The condition of Catholicism in North Korea is far worse than in either China or Vietnam. Diplomatically, the issue is a thorny one where South Korean Catholicism exercises representation. For this reason, some are predicting that Pope Francis – a self-professed “pilgrim of peace” – is unlikely to pay an official visit to North Korea in the short term.

“It is the clear position of the Holy See Secretariat of State that a visit to Pyongyang by the Pope must be carried out in combination with the promotion of peace on the Korean Peninsula and pastoral aims,” a high-ranking figure in the South Korean Catholic community said. “There are a lot of problems that would need to be solved.”

Because of this situation, staging the visit sooner would require either an exceptional decision by the Pope or some form of workaround.

“The most realistic way of helping the Pope’s Pyongyang visit and meeting with Kim Jong-un happen quickly would be for the Pope to visit South Korea in the near future, using that as an occasion for visiting Pyongyang with representatives of the South Korean religious community,” a high-ranking figure in the religious community said.

“The situation for the North Korean church would have to improve a lot for the Pope to formally visit North Korea, and that’s not something that can be fixed in the short term,” the same figure said. A drawback of the proposed approach is that it would not actually be an official papal visit.

“An official visit by the Pope would be the best way for North Korea to emerge into the international community with its aspirations of being a normal state, and it would be very helpful for peace on the Korean Peninsula,” said Fr. Park Chang-il, who chairs the steering committee of the North Korea assistance group Peace 3000.

“The Vatican and North Korea and South and North Korea need to start now opening everything up to discussions and finding a way,” Park said.

Debate surrounds issue of what constitutes “irreversible denuclearization”,2018-10-19 14:44,North Korea,Kim Ji-eun,"The definition of “irreversible stage of denuclearization” is becoming a heated topic after South Korean President Moon Jae-in made remarks during his recent European tour calling for “further efforts to promote denuclearization by loosening UN sanctions once we have determined North Korea’s denuclearization has reached an irreversible stage.”

Neither the Blue House nor the Moon administration have yet offered a concrete explanation, while US nuclear experts have argued that the concept of “irreversible denuclearization” is impossible to define.

Voice of America quoted former International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) deputy director-general Olli Heinonen on Oct. 18 as saying two key measures would be needed to determine North Korea’s denuclearization had reached an “irreversible” stage. Specifically, it would require the overseas removal of all nuclear weapons from the North and the prior dismantling or disablement of facilities to produce highly enriched uranium, plutonium, and other nuclear materials, he said. Verification of these measures would also have to be included, he added.

Heinonen further said it would be impossible to conclude North Korea’s denuclearization had reached an “irreversible” stage even if it completed permanent dismantling and verification procedures for its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon. The claim is that because of the possibility that North Korea has at least one more enrichment facility outside of the Yongbyon complex, it could still produce highly enriched uranium even after the Yongbyon facility has been dismantled.

Because the precise scale of nuclear material in North Korea’s possession has not been established, measures beyond the Yongbyon facility’s dismantlement would be needed for denuclearization to reach an irreversible stage, Heinonen said.

Nuclear expert and Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) president David Albright was reported by the same network as saying an “irreversible” stage of denuclearization was impossible to define. He too cited the lack of precise knowledge about the scale of North Korea’s nuclear weapons. Noting that dismantling and verification of the nuclear facilities at Yongbyon and elsewhere would represent major progress, he cautioned at the same time against overlooking the fact that North Korea still possesses dozens of nuclear weapons.

S. Korea expects “positive outcome” from discussions with US on inter-Korean railways and roads,2018-10-19 14:40,North Korea,Hwang Joon-bum,"The South Korean government said on Oct. 18 that it is looking forward to a “positive outcome” from close discussions with Washington on plans to hold a groundbreaking ceremony for linkage of inter-Korean railways and roads.

Differences between the two sides over the issue have led to claims of “cracks” developing in their coordination.

“We are cooperating closely with the US, and we expect a positive outcome,” said Blue House spokesperson Kim Eui-kyum in a briefing that day on the decision to hold a groundbreaking ceremony in late November or early December for the linkage and modernization of South and North Korean railways and roads.

South and North Korea previously agreed at high-level talks on Oct. 15 to hold the groundbreaking ceremony in November or December. Where asked for comment by the press, the US State Department said improvements in inter-Korean relations could not move separately from resolution of North Korea’s nuclear program. In particular, it said it expected “all member states to fully implement UN sanctions, including sectoral goods banned under UN Security Council resolutions” – a message some analysts saw as voicing concerns that Seoul was getting ahead of Washington on the matter.



Claims of cracks in the two sides’ cooperation were fed by seemingly contradictory remarks on Oct. 17 by South Korean Ambassador to the US Cho Yoon-je and US Ambassador to South Korea Harry Harris at respective events in Washington and Seoul, with Cho stressing that inter-Korean relations and denuclearization “can’t always move mechanically at the same speed” and Harris arguing that inter-Korean dialogue and North Korean denuclearization must be tied together, with Seoul and Washington approaching the situation “with a common voice.”

The Blue House’s predictions of a “positive outcome” were taken as signaling that the two sides are finishing their coordination over the issues of sanctions violations in connection with the groundbreaking ceremony for the inter-Korean railway and road linkage and modernization effort.

“We certainly understand patriotism, but we would like to ask people to stop worrying now,” Kim Eui-kyum said the previous day in response to domestic concerns about fissures in the two sides’ cooperation. His message was seen as expressing confidence in the administration’s execution of the agreement between the South and North Korean leaders according to discussions with the US within a “framework of mutual consideration and cooperation” – even if Seoul and Washington do not agree 100 percent of the time on the rate of progress in inter-Korean relations.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un agreed in their Pyongyang Joint Declaration last month on a firm schedule of holding the groundbreaking ceremony for linkage of the East and West Sea railway lines and roads “within this year.”



Regarding the possibility of the agreement’s implementation resulting in violation of sanctions against North Korea, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Oct. 16 that it was “being pursued under a principle of abiding by the framework of North Korea sanctions.”

“We have held close discussions with the US and plan to continue those discussions going ahead,” the ministry said.

The administration has also reportedly been in discussions with Washington, approaching the matter as one where – as Cho said on Oct. 16 – Seoul could “play the role of catalyst in North Korea-US relations in the event that inter-Korean relations get a bit ahead of North Korea-US negotiations.” In an Oct. 17 talk with foreign correspondents in Washington, Cho addressed the alarm in the US over differences in the rate of developments in inter-Korean and North Korea-US relations.

“The leverage that is being established with North Korea through progress in inter-Korean relations is becoming a crucial diplomatic asset in terms of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and establishing peace,” he said.

ROK ambassador to US says inter-Korean relations and denuclearization move at different speeds,2018-10-18 16:46,North Korea,Hwang Joon-bum,"“Inter-Korean relations and the process of denuclearization can’t always move at the same speed,” said South Korean Ambassador to the US Cho Yoon-je on Oct. 16. Cho was expressing the South Korean government’s position in regard to American concerns that South Korea efforts to improve relations with North Korea are getting ahead of North Korea’s denuclearization.

“The position of this government is that the development of inter-Korean relations needs to move forward along with the process of denuclearization and that international sanctions must be implemented faithfully,” Cho said during a keynote speech at the Seoul-Washington Forum, jointly hosted in Washington on Tuesday by South Korea’s Sejong Institute and the US Council on Foreign Relations. But that doesn’t mean that inter-Korean relations and denuclearization can move at the same speed, Cho added, remarking that “the momentum on one side can drive the process on the other and create a virtuous cycle.”

“When inter-Korean relations are moving a little faster than North Korea-US dialogue, that gives South Korea the leverage to act as a facilitator and enables it to break through deadlocks between North Korea and the US,” Cho said.

Cho cited the two inter-Korean summits as examples: “The inter-Korean summit in April served as a springboard for the first North Korea-US summit, and the inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang in September breathed new life into North Korea-US dialogue. The two tracks of inter-Korean relations and denuclearization provide each other with momentum and enable us to keep moving forward.” Simultaneously, he underlined that “inter-Korean cooperation must be promoted inside the framework of international sanctions.”

Cho’s remarks were aimed to counter the disapproval of American experts and government officials who think that South and North Korea are “moving too fast” in their measures to implement the Apr. 27 Panmunjom Declaration and the Sept. Pyongyang Joint Declaration, both reached by the leaders of the two sides. Leading up to the opening of the Inter-Korean Liaison Office in Kaesong on Sept. 14, the US government cautioned that inter-Korean relations need to move in sync with denuclearization. After South and North Korea agreed on Oct. 15 to hold a groundbreaking ceremony for connecting the roads and railways along the East and West Seas in late November or early December, the US government reiterated this position and underlined the need to adhere to the sanctions.

In regard to doubts inside the US about North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, Cho said, “The leaders of South Korea, North Korea and the US have reconfirmed the joint goal of denuclearization in their meetings together, and the North Korea expressed its willingness in the Pyongyang Joint Declaration to allow inspectors into Punggye Village and to permanently dismantle its Yongbyon nuclear facility. These are huge steps that give an opportunity for an unprecedented amount of progress.”

“It’s obviously important to keep testing and verifying North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, but the best approach is to strive to lead North Korea to take more important steps and Kim Jong-un to keep the promises he has made,” Cho went on to say.



In regard to concerns about the end-of-war declaration, Cho said, “Since this is a political declaration without legal binding power, it would have no effect on the armistice agreement, the South Korea-US alliance or the US troop presence on the Korean Peninsula. Kim Jong-un has also expressed his definite understanding of this.”

During the forum, South Korea was represented by Baek Jong-chun, chairman of the Sejong Institute; Paik Hak-soon, the institute’s president; Kim Joon-hyung, professor at Handong Global University; Lee Geun, professor at Seoul National University; and Wi Seong-rak, former director of South Korea's office for negotiating peace on the Korean Peninsula.

The US was represented by Scott Snyder, director of the Korean program at the Council on Foreign Relations; Robert Gallucci, professor at Georgetown University; Evans Revere, the US State Department’s former principal deputy assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs; Kathleen Stephens, president of the Korea Economic Institute of America; and David Maxwell, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.



On the same day, the National Assembly’s Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee held a parliamentary audit at South Korea’s delegation to the UN in New York. During the audit, Bareunmirae Party lawmaker Rep. Chung Byeong-guk asked South Korean Ambassador to the UN Cho Tae-yul whether the project to link South and North Korea’s roads and railways would violate the UN Security Council’s sanctions against North Korea.

“That decision would be made by the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee on North Korea,” Cho said. “When the project moves forward in earnest, there would be some aspects that might be in violation of the sanctions. Right now, though, we’re planning to hold a groundbreaking, not actually start the project. This is the beginning of the process.”

When Rep. Cheon Jeong-bae, a lawmaker with the Party for Democracy and Peace, asked if there was a way to move forward with the inter-Korean road and railway connection project and inter-Korean economic cooperation projects without violating sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council and by the US, Cho said that that would be “impossible.” When Democratic Party lawmaker Rep. Song Yeong-gil noted that preliminary measures should be taken to ensure that the road and railway connection project doesn’t violate sanctions, Cho said that South Korea was “deliberating closely with the US.”

The very same day, the US was ramping up pressure about maintaining sanctions on North Korea. Stephen Biegun, the US State Department’s Special Representative for North Korea, met with Russian Deputy Foreign Ministers Igor Morgulov and Sergey Ryabkov in Moscow on Tuesday and discussed efforts to achieve North Korea’s final, fully verified denuclearization, or FFVD, the State Department said.

According to the State Department, Biegun emphasized to his counterparts the need to continue fully coordinating their communication to enable the process of denuclearization to proceed as quickly as possible and to enable steps to be taken that will provide a brighter future for North Korea. The State Department also said that the US is focusing on cooperating with Russia and other related countries on the implementation of the strong and ongoing UN sanctions against North Korea with the goal of achieving progress on denuclearization.

"Kim Jong-un to visit Russia before US midterm elections, Russian newspaper reports",2018-10-17 16:26,North Korea,Kim Mi-na,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is planning to visit Russia before the US midterm elections that will be held early next month, a Russian newspaper reported on Oct. 16.

Kim will be visiting Russia at the end of October or the beginning of November, before the midterm elections on Nov. 6, daily newspaper Izvestia reported, quoting three South Korean diplomatic sources. According to the newspaper, Moscow and Vladivostok are being considered as locations for the summit.

“The North Korean leader [Kim Jong-un] has been invited to visit Russia. We’re reviewing the possible date, location and manner of visit,” said Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov.

The North Korean embassy in Moscow told Izvestia that it didn’t have any information about Kim’s visit to Russia but that “the exact date will depend on the decision of the two leaders.”


Russia has invited Kim to visit several times since dialogue between North Korea and the US began with the goal of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The first indication came when Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met Kim during a visit to Pyongyang on May 31 and delivered a personal letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin inviting Kim to visit Russia.

At the time, Lavrov reportedly communicated Putin’s hope that Kim would either attend the Eastern Economic Forum, which was held in Vladivostok in September, or make a separate trip to Russia. Russian Federation Council (Senate) Chairwoman Valentina Ivanovna Matviyenko, who visited North Korea to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of North Korea’s government on Sept. 9, said during a recent visit to South Korea that Kim’s visit to Russia could take place this year.

And during the cabinet meeting on Oct. 8, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he expected Kim’s visit to Russia to happen soon in addition to the second North Korea-US summit, and that Chinese President Xi Jinping would be visiting North Korea as well.

Izvestia also quoted experts as saying that Kim’s visit to Russia was expected to give him more room to maneuver in the upcoming second North Korea-US summit. Experts said that Kim’s best option was to arrange for Xi to make his first visit to Pyongyang and to wrap up his summit with Putin before his summit with US President Donald Trump, thus securing the support of both Russia and China before the summit. With attention riveted on the upcoming North Korea-US summit, Trump said the summit would take place after the US midterm elections on Nov. 6.

North Korea’s demands shifting from end-of-war declaration to easing of UN sanctions,2018-10-17 16:24,North Korea,Lee Je-hun,"The focus of the “corresponding measures” that North Korea is publicly demanding from the US in exchange for its denuclearization is rapidly shifting from a formal declaration of the end of the Korean War to the issue of sanctions.

This change has been noticeable since US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s fourth visit to North Korea on Oct. 7. Some analysts think this is because the two sides came to an understanding about the end-of-war declaration during Pompeo’s meeting in Pyongyang with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

This focus is thought to represent North Korea’s intense desire for easing sanctions to be one of the major items on the negotiating table along with the end-of-war declaration in the run-up to the meeting between North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui and US State Department Special Representative for North Korean Policy Stephen Biegun, which will function as “working-level talks” prior to the second North Korea-US summit.

The US’ plans to maintain and even strengthen sanctions came under fire in a column signed by a private individual titled “What can we learn from the nasty things being said in the US?” published by North Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), which is doctored for external consumption, on Oct. 16. “Considering how much time has passed since we stopped our nuclear tests and suspended our ICBM launches, it is only right for the sanctions to disappear accordingly, considering that they were concocted on the pretext of those actions,” the column said.

“It’s customary to give back as much as you take, but the US keeps taking without giving anything in return. This could cause the US to be criticized around the world for ‘swallowing the chicken whole without burping even once [trying to have its cake and eat it too].’” In this column, which ran for about 1,500 words, the word “sanctions” appeared 17 times, but the phrase “end-of-war declaration” did not appear even once.

Ever since North Korea publicly mentioned the end-of-war declaration in a statement by the spokesperson of its Foreign Ministry on July 7 in connection with Pompeo’s third visit to North Korea on July 6 and 7, it has repeatedly brought up this issue as a prime example of the corresponding measures it wants from the US.

The first time that a high-ranking North Korean publicly and officially mentioned the word “sanctions” after the North Korea-US summit on June 12 was during the keynote address to the UN General Assembly by North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Sept. 29, in which Ri said, “The problem is that the sanctions are aggravating our distrust.” But even after that, the North Koreans had strongly pushed the issue of an end-of-war declaration. One of the best examples was a column in the KCNA on Oct. 2 titled “The end of the war isn’t a gift to be given.”

But since Kim and Pompeo’s meeting, the focus of the North’s demands from the US has shifted. This is consistent with the joint statement released after trilateral negotiations between the vice foreign ministers of North Korea, China and Russia held in Moscow on Oct. 9, in which the three sides said it was time to start reconsidering the sanctions imposed on North Korea.

“This is probably because [the North Koreans] have concluded that some kind of understanding was reached on the issue of the end-of-war declaration during Secretary Pompeo’s fourth visit to North Korea,” said a diplomatic source who is well-informed about North Korea-US relations.

“The end-of-war declaration is just a matter of time; I believe that it will definitely happen,” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in an interview with the BBC on Oct. 12, the day before he embarked on a tour of Europe.

South and North Korea adopt joint statement following high-level talks at Panmunjom,2018-10-16 17:32,North Korea,Lee Je-hun,"During high-level talks held at the House of Peace in Panmunjom on Oct. 15, South and North Korea adopted a joint statement containing seven points about the scheduling of cooperation projects and follow-up talks in various areas necessary for implementing the Pyongyang Joint Declaration, which resulted from the inter-Korean summit held in September.

The follow-up meetings arranged for the implementation of the Pyongyang Declaration are military general-level talks (location undecided, to be held “soon”), a meeting of the forestry cooperation subcommittee (Kaesong Joint Liaison Office, Oct. 22), a meeting of the health and medical care subcommittee (Kaesong Joint Liaison Office, late October), sports talks (Kaesong Joint Liaison Office, end of October) and Red Cross talks (Mt. Kumkang, November).

The cooperation projects that were scheduled include working-level deliberations to be held “soon” for a North Korean concert in South Korea in October, the on-site joint survey of the North Korean section of the Gyeongui (Seoul-Sinuiju) railroad in late October, an on-site joint survey of the North Korean section of the East Sea railroad in early November; and a groundbreaking ceremony in late November or early December for a project to connect and modernize the roads and railways along the East and West Seas.

One important feature of this agreement is that the Inter-Korean Joint Liaison Office in Kaesong, which opened on Sept. 14 to implement one of the main points agreed to in the Apr. 27 Panmunjom Declaration, has emerged as the primary scene for inter-Korean governmental talks, beginning with these high-level talks. This represents a major leap forward in the systematization of inter-Korean relations.



Yet another feature was South and North Korea’s pragmatic and results-oriented attitude during the talks. By finalizing the schedule of agenda items when possible and postponing matters that required further discussion or action, representatives from the two sides were able to wrap up the talks in five hours and 16 minutes. This is incredibly fast, given the vast scope and difficulty of the agenda of “devising measures for implementing the Pyongyang Declaration.” This can be seen as building on the foundation of mutual trust that South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have built during three summits.

The most striking agreement reached was creating a timetable for the road and railway cooperation project. While the Pyongyang Declaration only said that the groundbreaking for the connection and modernization of roads and railways on the East and West Sea lines would take place “within the year,” inter-Korean negotiators accelerated the timeframe and narrowed it down to “late November or early December.”

This is thought to express Kim Jong-un’s intention of holding the groundbreaking prior to his “return visit to Seoul within the year.” Leading up to the groundbreaking, the two sides agreed to initiate joint surveys of the northern stretch of the Gyeongui line “in late October” and of the East Sea line “in early November.” The schedule for the joint surveys of the roads along the West and East Seas is supposed to be confirmed via correspondence. Crossing the demilitarized zone (DMZ) will require prior consultation with the UN Command and effectively with the American government.



Also remarkable was the agreement to convene the health and medical care subcommittee at the Kaesong liaison office at the end of October “to prevent the influx and spread of infectious diseases.” The Unification Ministry announced it would use this meeting to create a “health community on the Korean Peninsula.” Cooperation in health and medical care drawing a lot of attention not only because of the urgency of humanitarian measures, but also because it would create momentum on the Mother and Child Health and Nutrition project, organized by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP).

On Sept. 21, 2017, the South Korean government promised to give the project US$8 million from the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund, but the funds have yet to be disbursed. Providing US$8 million to this project would have major political consequences since it would point the way to securing and expanding humanitarian aid, which represents an exception to the tough sanctions imposed on North Korea.

The question of creating and operating a joint military commission to coordinate the implementation of the “Agreement on the Implementation of the Historic Panmunjom Declaration in the Military Domain,” which is regarded as the greatest achievement in inter-Korean relations to result from the Pyongyang summit this past September, will be discussed during talks between generals that are supposed to be held “soon.”

South Korean government officials believe that these talks will be held between Oct. 20, when the mine removal work at the Panmunjom area comes to an end, and Nov. 1, when measures are implemented to end hostile behavior in the air around the military demarcation line.

The Red Cross talks for the divided family reunions, which have a major impact on public opinion in South Korea, were pushed back to November, presumably because North Korea’s “confiscation” of the divided family reunion building needs to be addressed before the talks can be held. The North announced it had confiscated the building on Apr. 27, 2010, when inter-Korean conflict was intensifying after the sinking of the Cheonan corvette.

South and North Korea agreed to hold sports talks around the end of the month to “deliberate the question of jointly participating in international competitions, including the 2020 Summer Olympics [in Tokyo], and of jointly hosting the 2032 Summer Olympics.”

Controversy erupts over military officials’ decision to purchase SM-3 interceptors,2018-10-15 17:17,North Korea,Park Byong-su,"Controversy is brewing after revelations that military authorities effectively demanded the purchasing of SM-3 missiles. Many analysts contend that the SM-3 is unsuited to the Korean Peninsula battlefield environment as a ballistic missile interceptor.

The attempt by military authorities to introduce the SM-3 was confirmed in a parliamentary audit of the Joint Chiefs of Staff by the National Assembly National Defense Committee. When asked by Democratic Party lawmaker and committee chair Ahn Gyu-back if a decision had been made on the SM-3’s introduction, JCS force planning department chief and Army Maj. Gen. Kim Seon-ho said, “A decision on the cost was made at a Sept. 2017 Joint Chiefs meeting.”

“The decision was for something at the SM-3 level,” he added.

Designed to intercept enemy ballistic missiles in midair, the SM-3 is launched from Aegis-equipped naval vessels. The SM-3 block IB developed by the US defense contractor Raytheon has an interception altitude in the 150–500km range, while the modified SM-3 block IIA jointly developed by the US and Japan has a reported interception altitude of 1,000km.

Explaining the role of the SM-3, Kim described it as part of a “system for intercepting enemy ballistic missiles at the upper tier of KAMD (the Korean Air and Missile Defense System).”

The plan described would create a four-level missile defense system adding the SM-3 at the top tier of the current three-level system in which incoming ballistic missiles would be intercepted in turn by THAAD, the L-SAM system, and Patriot missiles (or the M-SAM system).

But even within the military, many say the SM-3 is of limited use militarily. To begin with, it could not be used to stop North Korean ballistic missiles from landing on South Korean territory. Because of the Korean Peninsula’s small size – less than 500km in length from north to south – the biggest threats to South Korea are short-range missiles such as the Scud-B (with a range of 300km) and Scud-C (500km). For the most part, Scud missiles do not exceed a peak altitude of 150km.

With a minimum interception altitude of 150km, the SM-3 would not even have the opportunity to intercept them. In a May 1999 report to US Congress titled “Theater Missile Defense Architecture Options in The Asia-Pacific Region,” the Pentagon expressed a negative view.

“With a minimum intercept altitude of about 100 kilometers, the sea-based upper tier exo systems [like the SM-3] could not defend the northern two-thirds of the ROK [where most of the population and key facilities are located] against the low flying short range TBMs,” the report said.



The SM-3 is more effective in defending Japan, Okinawa, or US-controlled Guam. The missiles that North Korea would use in attacks on these regions have maximum altitudes over 150km, such as the Rodong missile (range of 1,200km) or Hwasong-12 (estimated range of 4,000–4,500km). Missiles of this kind approaching Japan or Guam could be intercepted using Aegis-equipped naval vessels in the East Sea. Indeed, mention of the SM-3’s adoption in the past has raised ongoing questions about whether it would be used to defend US forces in Japan or on Guam rather than in South Korea.

At the same time, adopting SM-3 on Aegis-equipped ships has been a longstanding aim of the South Korean Navy. Former Minister of National Defense Song Young-moo, himself a former Navy admiral, was especially proactive about the SM-3’s adoption. In a joint briefing by the Ministers of National Defense, Interior and Safety, and Environment in Sept. 2017, Song said, “In talking about things like introducing the SM-3 in the Korean missile defense system, we’re envisioning the creation of a multi-tier defense system.”

Sources in and around the military also said Song’s views had much to do with the Joint Chiefs’ decision in Sept. 2017 to present costs for the SM-3.

But adoption of the SM-3 could also throw cold water on the recent drive toward North Korea’s denuclearization and improvement in relations on the Korean Peninsula.

“If we were to push for the SM-3’s adoption after South and North Korean military authorities adopted an agreement with plans for arms controls and detente as an ancillary agreement to the Pyongyang Joint Declaration in September, North Korea is very likely to take that as a provocation,” a military official said.

No final decision has yet been made on purchasing the SM-3. Once the individual armed forces and Joints Chief of Staff propose costs for the purchasing of weaponry, it typically goes through a process of preliminary Agency for Defense Development (ADD) research, a vote by the defense project promotion committee (chaired by the Minister of National Defense), a feasibility examination by the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses (KIDA), and reflection in the budget.

Sources reported that the preliminary research has been completed, with the purchase to be put before the defense project promotion committee as early as this or next month.

US experts on nuclear nonproliferation say demanding full inventory of NK arsenal is unrealistic,2018-10-15 17:14,North Korea,Kim Ji-eun,"At the current stage, US experts on Korean Peninsula issues say it’s unrealistic to ask North Korea to submit a full inventory of its nuclear and weapon facilities. Instead, they suggested that the US should persuade the North to suspend the production of nuclear material and reveal the relevant facilities. As a corresponding measure, the US could officially declare the end of the Korean War and make a joint declaration with South Korea or hold a multilateral peace conference.

Considering that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s fourth trip to North Korea has made a second North Korea-US summit more of a possibility, North Korea’s initial steps toward denuclearization and the US’s corresponding measures will be the focus of discussions during the upcoming North Korea-US working-level negotiations.

During an interview with Voice of America (VOA) on Oct. 12, Robert Einhorn, former US Department of State special advisor for nonproliferation and arms control, advised against asking the North Koreans to hand over a complete and comprehensive inventory of nuclear weapons and facilities from the very beginning. Einhorn instead suggested asking the North to disclose and suspend all activities related to the production of nuclear materials, which would include not only the Yongbyon nuclear complex but other facilities that produce nuclear materials.

If North Korea could be persuaded to disclose the location of these facilities before the inspectors paid a visit, Einhorn said, that would constitute a very important first step.
　
The most noteworthy of Einhorn’s proposals was his suggestion that the measures were achievable without immediately disclosing the scale and location of all the North’s nuclear weapons and missile.

“That [approach] would not reveal the number or location of North Korea’s weapon or missiles,” he said, adding that the first stage of reporting for nuclear material production facilities might be a measure Pyongyang is prepared to take.

Some South Korean experts also claim North Korea could report a primary nuclear list while omitting the actual locations during its process of permanently dismantling its Tongchang missile engine testing and launch sites and the nuclear facilities at Yongbyon.



Mansfield Foundation president Frank Jannuzi suggested persuading North Korea to submit a full list of facilities related to nuclear material production as an initial step toward denuclearization, explaining that this would be different from demanding a list of all of the North’s nuclear facilities. He accordingly suggested the top priority should be on obtaining a full list of fissile material production facilities, including the Yongbyon reactor and other highly enriched uranium (HEU) production facilities at Yongbyon and in other regions.

Yongbyon is the site of a 5MW graphite-moderated reactor for plutonium production and uranium enrichment facilities visited in 2010 by Stanford University emeritus professor Siegfried Hecker.

The US has also alleged that North Korea has other undisclosed uranium enrichment facilities at Kangson and other locations.

As a corresponding US measure, Einhorn proposed a “conditional” end-of-war declaration. Declaring such a declaration to be a possible form of corresponding measure, he suggested an approach of issuing “in parallel with any end-of-war declaration [. . .] a US-ROK high-level statement [. . .] that reaffirms the importance of the US-ROK security alliance and the importance of maintaining US military forces in South Korea even after [. . .] a peace treaty is ultimately achieved.”

Jannuzi suggested a suitable approach may be for the US, South and North Korea, and China to hold a peace meeting to establish the details of an end-of-war plan rather than attempting to end the more than 70-year long Korean War with a declaration.

VOA reported Jannuzi as saying that details on the easing of sanctions – another form of corresponding measure desired by Pyongyang – will be discussed in working-level negotiations, adding that reductions should be weighed very carefully as the results of concrete actions corresponding to North Korea’s concrete denuclearization steps.

The letter states that around 100,000 US citizens currently have relatives residing in North Korea, and that the majority of them have not seen their families since the war. The letter urges Trump to take action on the reunions on a humanitarian basis. (Yonhap News)"
Moon says Kim Jong-un is willing to get rid of everything in nuclear program,2018-10-13 14:48,North Korea,Seong Yeon-cheol,"On Oct. 12, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said that the denuclearization discussed by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un means getting rid of everything, including all of the North’s current nuclear weapons and nuclear materials. Moon was also optimistic about the end-of-war declaration by South Korea, North Korea and the US, which he described as “just a matter of time” and something that “will definitely happen.”

Moon made the remarks during an interview with the BBC on Friday, prior to a nine-day tour of Europe that will begin on Oct. 13. “The complete denuclearization that Kim Jong-un is talking about includes everything, starting with no more testing of nuclear weapons or missiles and continuing with shutting down the facilities used to produce nuclear weapons and develop missiles and getting rid of all the nuclear weapons and materials currently in their possession,” he said.

This is the first time Kim has specifically communicated to Moon his intention to give up not only his “past nukes” (the ones already built) and “future nukes” (future development and testing aimed at enhancing his nuclear capability) but also his “present nukes,” which is to say the North’s current nuclear arsenal. North Korea appears to be indicating that it’s completely willing to submit its nuclear weapon inventory, which it has been strongly reluctant to do, provided that there are “corresponding measures” from the US, including an end-of-war declaration.

When asked whether the end-of-war declaration will take place within the year, Moon said the “end-of-war declaration is just a matter of time; I believe that it will definitely happen.”

“The end-of-war declaration has been adequately discussed with the US, including with President Donald Trump. It’s a political declaration wrapping up the long-standing hostile relationship between North Korea and the US, provided that the North takes certain measures. South Korea and the US are in agreement that the declaration should take place as soon as possible,” Moon said.



Moon also asked the international community for its enthusiastic cooperation in regard to relaxing sanctions on North Korea. When asked about Trump’s remark that South Korea can’t ease sanctions on the North without the US’s approval, Moon said he regards this as a “generic statement of the fact that, up to a certain point, South Korea and the US have to cooperate closely and coordinate their movements in regard to international sanctions.”

At the same time, Moon emphasized that the option of easing the sanctions should be considered when North Korea’s denuclearization reaches a certain point. “Once North Korea’s denuclearization arrives at a certain stage, we’ll need to seriously consider gradually easing economic sanctions on the North. If the North continues to take sincere steps toward denuclearization and reaches what we believe to be the point of no return, the UN can begin to ease its sanctions,” he said.

Moon predicted that the second North Korea-US summit would be held immediately after the US midterm elections, which are scheduled for Nov. 6.

“I’m told the two sides are working on the technical issues of time and location for the second summit so that it can be held soon after the US midterm elections. I hope that the two leaders will reach a bold agreement on the timetable so that North Korea’s denuclearization measures and the US’s corresponding measures can move forward quickly and simultaneously,” Moon said, revealing his high hopes.

Moon says Kim Jong-un placed no conditions on his speech to North Korean public,2018-10-13 14:44,North Korea,Seong Yeon-cheol,"“There wasn’t anything I was asked to say or not to say,” said South Korean President Moon Jae-in during an interview with the BBC on Oct. 12. Moon was talking about the speech he delivered before 150,000 North Korean citizens at the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium in Pyongyang on Sept. 19.

“Chairman Kim didn’t place any conditions on my speech. He didn’t even want to know what I was going to say before the speech, and he didn’t limit the length of the speech. He left the whole thing up to my judgment. I believe that shows the changes that are happening in North Korea right now and Kim’s immense trust in me,” Moon said.

Moon said he was “quite nervous” during the speech. “It was a very emotional moment, a moment in which I was reminded once more than the Koreans are one people. But all the same I was extremely nervous. I had to address the problem of denuclearization and had to receive positive vibes from the North Korean people. And also I had to satisfy the Korean public as well as the global public. Fortunately, I think I did a good job,” he said.

Moon reiterated that Kim Jong-un is a very humble leader. When asked what Kim was like, Moon said, “He’s very young, but he has the definite vision of developing his poor country. He’s very courteous and candid, while possessing a leadership of great humility that enables him to deal appropriately with his elders.”

[Photo] US Treasury asks S. Korean banks to follow UN sanctions just after Pyongyang summit,2018-10-13 14:40,North Korea,,"It has been confirmed that the US Department of the Treasury directly contacted South Korea’s government and commercial banks and asked for compliance regarding UN sanctions on North Korea. Instances of the US Department of the Treasury directly contacting individual South Korean banks are extremely rare. According to insiders in the financial industry, the US Treasury Department called seven banks -- including the state-owned Korea Development Bank and the Industrial Bank of Korea as well as the commercial banks Kookmin, Shinhan and Nonghyup -- and held a conference call on Sept. 20-21, directly after the inter-Korean Pyongyang summit on Sept. 19."

The date and location of the talks was announced by the Ministry of Unification in a press release on Oct. 12. Additionally, the two sides are expected to negotiate the details for further talks in various areas. The above photo shows South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader after signing the Pyongyang Declaration on Sept. 19."
Unification minister says there’s no “concrete review of lifting the May Measures”,2018-10-12 17:56,North Korea,Yoo Kang-moon,"On Oct. 11, Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said “there’s never been a concrete review of lifting the May 24 Measures.” After making this remark during the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee’s parliamentary audit, which was held at the National Assembly on Thursday, Cho underlined that “this is the government’s basic position.” 

Cho’s remarks appear to be part of a government effort to calm the controversy stirred up by Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha’s remark the previous day that lifting the May 24 Measures “is under review with related ministries.”

While this controversy began with Kang’s “imprecise remark,” it ultimately served as a reminder of the difficulties faced by the administration of South Korean President Moon Jae-in as it attempts to expand inter-Korean cooperation amid sanctions on North Korea by the US and the international community. Even US President Donald Trump waded into the fray to reconfirm the US’ position that sanctions on North Korea will be maintained until the North denuclearizes. This teaches the Moon administration a hard lesson about the stubbornness of sanctions on North Korea.

This controversy has centered on the May 24 Measures, sanctions against North Korea that were imposed as an executive order by the administration of ex-president Lee Myung-bak in response to the sinking of the Cheonan corvette in Mar. 2010. 

The measures included suspending inter-Korean trade except for the Kaesong Industrial Complex, preventing North Korean ships from navigating in South Korean waters, blocking visits to North Korea except for the Kaesong Complex and Mt. Kumgang, banning new investment in North Korea and suspending North Korean aid projects. Since the measures were an administrative action by the government, the government has the authority to relax, or even lift, them at any time.



In fact, the Lee administration tweaked the May 24 Measures the next year to allow toll processing products to be brought into North Korea, and it also accepted applications for religious figures to visit the North. The following administration, under ex-president Park Geun-hye, allowed inter-Korean logistic cooperation and permitted NGOs to provide the North with fertilizer. As a consequence, the measures can be described as basically obsolete, except for their suspension of inter-Korean trade and ban on new investment. 

The ban on North Korean vessels entering South Korean waters is also set to be scrapped, with the military agreement adopted in the Sept. 19 Pyongyang Joint Statement stating that “the two sides’ joint military committee will deliberate the questions of North Korean ships’ use of the Haeju port in Hwanghae Province to travel directly through South Korean maritime territory, as well as North Korean ships’ passage through the Jeju Strait, and devise a solution.”



The reason the government has nonetheless declined to explicitly lift the May 24 Measures is because the suspension of inter-Korean trade and the ban on new investment are linked to UN and US sanctions on North Korea. Since inter-Korean trade and new investment are both blocked by the international community’s sanctions on North Korea, neither of them could be implemented even if the May 24 Measures were lifted. 

Simply put, there is nothing to gain from lifting the measures. Furthermore, the government is forced to consider the political fallout of lifting the measures before North Korea has taken action related to the sinking of the Cheonan.

In the end, the crux of the matter is that independent action by South Korea is unable to slip through the fine net of the international community’s sanctions on North Korea. Sanctions on North Korea are also largely responsible for the South’s inability to resume tourism to Mt. Kumgang. Tourism to Mt. Kumgang was halted in response to the fatal shooting of South Korean tourist Park Wang-ja by a North Korean sentry in 2008, and thus has nothing to do with the May 24 Measures. 

The difficulty of resuming tours has much more to do with the ban on financial transactions and on the payment of bulk cash to North Korea.

“Starting up tourism to Mt. Kumgang might be subject to UN sanctions,” said Cho, the Unification Minister.

Reopening the Kaesong Complex is also beset with similar problems. The Park administration decided to suspend operations at the Kaesong Complex in Feb. 2016 in response to North Korea’s fourth nuclear test and its launch of long-range missiles. It turned out that Park had made this decision arbitrarily, but its effect is now backed up by UN sanctions that ban the establishment or expansion of joint ventures with North Korea.

Cho adopted a cautious stance in regard to reopening the Kaesong Complex. “A number of factors must be considered, since we have to stay in line with progress toward denuclearization,” he said.
