N.Korean Laborer Sues Dutch Firm Over Slavery,2018-11-09 13:26,north korea,Jung Ji-sup,"A North Korean laborer who worked in a shipyard in Poland for several years accuses a Dutch shipbuilding company of exploitation in ""slave-like conditions."" Dutch law firm Prakken d'Oliveira said Thursday that it filed a complaint on behalf of the laborer against the shipbuilder, whose name was not revealed, taking advantage of a Dutch law that makes profiting from exploitation a criminal offense even if the company was not the victim's direct employer. Reuters reported that this is the first time ever that a North Korean laborer has taken legal action in a third country. To protect the laborer, the law firm did not reveal his identity. The laborer claims that he was forced to work 12 hours a day in slave-like conditions for Polish shipyard Crist SA, but the Dutch shipbuilder, despite knowing the situation, continued to place orders with the shipyard. The laborer is believed to have escaped and sought asylum. Poland has been a European hub for North Korean labor exports. European human rights organizations have exposed the dire working and living conditions of North Korean workers in Poland on multiple occasions, but this is the first time legal action has been taken, and activists hope the landmark lawsuit will create momentum to turn the international spotlight on the gross human rights violations suffered by North Korean laborers abroad. The UN estimates that there are 50,000 to 60,000 North Korean laborers around the world who earn hard currency for the regime. Read this article in Korean "
Impoverished N.Korea Plans Asia's Biggest Water Park,2018-11-08 12:38,north korea,Yoon Hyung-jun,"North Korea plans to build the largest water park in Asia at the scenic Mt. Kumgang resort with foreign investment even as severe food shortages loom amid international sanctions. North Korea's Kumgangsan International Travel Agency posted an investors' guide on its website detailing plans for the water park. According to the guide, the water park will cover 200,000 sq.m in Kosong, Kangwon Province, making it the biggest in Asia. The idea is to operate it as a joint venture for 10 years, and the travel agency claims construction will only take six months. The agency also said there will be an exhibition center for products from the Mt. Kumgang region as well as a hospital and 700-room hotel. The North is desperate for foreign investment to develop its tourism industry and recently opened a website detailing 14 projects involving a hotel, a power generation facility, railways, restaurants and other services in Wonsan. The North apparently hopes to cushion some of the effects of the sanctions, which ban imports of materials and cash but not tourism itself. This is probably why North Korean leader Kim Jong-un recently visited the Samjiyon area as well looking out masterfully over deserted beaches in Wonsan and Kalma, which are being eyed as tourism destinations. UN Security Council resolutions prohibit the establishment of any joint ventures with North Korean groups or individuals, so the water park is currently a castle in the air. Cho Young-gi at Kookmin University said North Korea ""appears to be preparing ahead for an easing of sanctions. This may also be a form of pressure on the South Korean government to invest money.""

N.Korean Crime Rackets Try to Bring in Hard Currency,2018-11-07 11:27,north korea,Yoon Hyung-jun,"North Korea is resorting to computer hacking, trade in protected animals and other organized crime to earn foreign currency.

Defectors Blame Kim Jong-un for N.Korea's Economic Failure,2018-11-05 12:56,north korea,Kim Myong-song,"The living conditions of North Koreans have deteriorated since the isolated state allocated huge sums of money to developing nuclear weapons and testing long-range missiles, prompting unprecedented U.S. sanctions. The conclusion comes from interviews the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University conducted with 87 defectors who fled the North last year and this year. Only about one-third said they had enough to eat, and many said they went hungry ""once in a while"" or ""often."" Not many earned more than W100,000 in South Korean money a month. Asked what they felt was the biggest stumbling block to North Korea's economic development, about half blamed Kim Jong-un, and many cited the bureaucracy. About half said Kim is doing a poor job, though the rest still feel he is doing well even though they have fled the country. Asked why they defected, about half cited dissatisfaction with the regime or other political reasons, but a quarter gave economic reasons. "

"Report: N.Korea Readies Nuclear, Missile Sites for International Inspectors",2018-11-01 08:14,north korea,VOA News,"South Korea's spy agency has observed preparations by North Korea for international inspections at several of its nuclear and missile test sites, the Yonhap news agency said on Wednesday, citing a South Korean lawmaker. Kim Min-ki of the ruling Democratic Party told reporters the South's National Intelligence Service observed North Koreans ""conducting preparation and intelligence activities that seem to be in preparation for foreign inspectors' visit"" at Punggye-ri nuclear test site and the Sohae Satellite launching ground. The lawmaker added no major movements were seen at Yongbyon, the North's main nuclear complex. North Korea has stopped nuclear and missile tests in the past year, but it did not allow international inspections of its dismantling of Punggye-ri in May, drawing criticism that the action was merely for show and could be reversed. In September, its leader, Kim Jong-un, also pledged at a summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in to close Sohae and allow experts to observe the dismantling of the missile engine testing site and a launch pad.

"N.Koreans Continue to Work in China, Russia Despite UN Sanctions",2018-10-29 13:13,north korea,Lee Kil-seong,"China and Russia continue to be the weak links in international sanctions against the North, as they continue to allow North Korean workers to work there.

N.Korea's Economy Is Shrinking,2018-10-26 13:27,north korea,Kim Myong-song,"North Korea's economy will shrink five percent this year due to international sanctions, an expert said Thursday. Kim Byung-yeon at Seoul National University told Japan's Nihon Keizai Shimbun daily, ""If the sanctions are thoroughly implemented, North Korea's exports this year will dive about 90 percent compared to 2016, exerting a huge impact on its domestic prices."" Kim added, ""The North has come to the dialogue table, as its elite class were unable to benefit from trade [due to the sanctions] and the economically distressed ordinary people failed to understand their country's nuclear development program."" But he added that the North Korean regime will be able to hold out over the short term. Meanwhile, North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun daily slammed Australia's deployment of a navy frigate to monitor smuggling on the East China Sea, accusing the country of being a ""pawn"" of the U.S. ""when many UN members call for easing or lifting the sanctions against us."" The daily added that ""sanctions or diplomatic pressure do not work"" on North Korea. One researcher at a state-run think tank here said, ""This paradoxically shows how much North Korea wants the sanctions to end."" Cho Han-bum at the Korea Institute for National Unification said, ""The U.S. is not yielding in terms of sanctions and Kim Jong-un is getting really nervous."" Read this article in Korean "

1/4 of Rural Kids in N.Korea Underweight,2018-10-18 12:24,north korea,Kim Myong-song,"The UN Food and Agriculture Organization on Wednesday warned that rural poverty has reached alarming proportions in North Korea as the gap between city and country widens. According to the FAO's 2018 white paper, 15.6 million North Koreans now live in urban areas, accounting for 62 percent of the entire population of 25 million. That is a relatively slow increase from 58 percent in 1990. But young North Koreans are migrating to the cities, and the youth population per 1,000 ha of farmland dropped 11 percent from 974 in 1995 to 860 in 2015. The wealth gap between country and city is widening. One in every four rural children is undernourished and underweight and the North has the most serious poverty issue in East Asia, the FAO said.
