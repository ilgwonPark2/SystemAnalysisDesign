North Korea takes swipe at Japan over 'denial of past sins' ,2018-11-11 13:32,North Korea,,"North Korea's Rodong Sinmun lambasted Japan on Sunday for its ""denial of past sins"" committed against wartime forced labor victims. ""The Korean people will definitely exact an apology and compensation from Japan for its past sins,"" the North's official newspaper said, referring to Japan's recent protest over the South Korean Supreme Court's ruling on Oct. 30 to order a Japanese steelmaker to compensate four South Koreans for wartime forced labor and unpaid work. The top court upheld an appeals court ruling in 2013, which ordered Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (NSSM) to pay each plaintiff 100 million won ($87,720) in compensation. The newspaper called Japanese politicians' objections to the ruling, ""Yet another fuss that shows their shameless nature to escape responsibility for past sins."" The ruling is ""the reflection of South Korea's public sentiment to get paid for the unforgivable past sins committed by Japan,"" it said. Tokyo has decided to change the term for wartime forced laborers to a ""laborer from the former Joseon Peninsula,"" NHK reported Sunday. Joseon is the name for the last dynasty of Korea. Previously, it mainly called them ""drafted workers."" The recent move is seen here as Tokyo's attempt to conceal the fact that these laborers were forced to work against their will during the colonial period. Japanese lawmakers, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, have recently reiterated their government's official stance that Japan didn't force them to work, and that any wartime compensation issue was fully settled in the 1965 bilateral accord on normalizing the countries' diplomatic ties. But Seoul has argued the deal does not cover all issues, including Japan's wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women. (Yonhap) "
"Top officials of US, China discuss North Korea ",2018-11-10 12:32,North Korea,,"Top officials of the United States and China met in Washington on Friday to discuss their bilateral relationship and efforts to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons.In a press conference following the talks, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he urged China's cooperation on sanctions enforcement to help achieve the denuclearization of North Korea.""I expressed in our meeting today the importance of remaining united in pursuit of a final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea as agreed to by Chairman Kim in Singapore,"" he said, referring to the historic summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in June.""This means maintaining pressure through the continued strict enforcement of all U.N. Security Council (sanctions) resolutions,"" Pompeo said, adding that China's cooperation ""will help achieve meaningful breakthroughs on this important denuclearization issue.""The U.S. and China have been at odds over sanctions policy, with Washington insisting that the sanctions remain on until North Korea fully dismantles its nuclear program and Beijing calling for a gradual easing of sanctions in return for Pyongyang's disarmament steps.Speaking alongside Pompeo, Yang Jiechi, director of the Chinese Communist Party's Office of Foreign Affairs, said the two sides held ""in-depth"" talks on the Korean Peninsula.""China reaffirmed its position and commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula, and a solution through conversation and negotiation,"" he said.On the sanctions, he said China will ""continue to enforce strictly"" the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.And on the diplomatic dialogue between the U.S. and North Korea, he said China hopes that the two sides will ""meet each other halfway, accommodate each other's legitimate concerns, build trust and advance the denuclearization process and the establishment of a peace mechanism in tandem.""His remarks come after a scheduled Thursday meeting between Pompeo and a top North Korean official in New York was postponed at the last minute due to what the U.S. said were scheduling issues.The sudden cancellation raised speculation that the North canceled the meeting in anger over the U.S. refusal to lift sanctions until after the full denuclearization of the regime.Friday's meeting, called the U.S.-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, was also joined by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis and his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe.Separately, South Korean Ambassador to the United States Cho Yoon-je called for confidence to further move North Korea's denuclearization forward and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula. ""We should note that confidence is the key to take a much bigger step in the future,"" Cho said, calling North Korea's suspension of nuclear and missile tests, and dismantlement of its nuclear test site ""a big progress"" in building confidence.The envoy made the comments in a speech earlier in the day after receiving the Distinguished Diplomatic Service Award from the World Affairs Council-Washington, DC, a nonprofit nonpartisan group, in recognition of his service to foreign affairs.The award has been given each year since 2009, and Cho is the first South Korean to receive it.

"NK media condemn SK-US working group, joint military drill ",2018-11-09 10:39,North Korea,,"North Korea's external propaganda media on Friday lashed out at recent decisions by South Korea and the United States to launch a working group on the North's denuclearization and resume a joint marine drill. Uriminzokkiri, a website run by Pyongyang, said that the working group plan underlines a ""wicked U.S. intent"" to hinder and destroy inter-Korean cooperation projects. ""The U.S. is about to set up an organ to directly monitor and control inter-Korean relations. It's an arrogant act. There are no grounds for the U.S. to intervene in the affairs between South and North Korea,"" said the website in a commentary. Seoul and Washington agreed last week to launch a joint working group for frequent and systemic discussions on denuclearization, a peace regime and sanctions on the North. On Monday, the allies resumed the Korea Marine Exercise Program (KMEP), which involves some 500 troops, including U.S. marines from Okinawa, Japan, and military equipment, such as amphibious assault vehicles. The Pyongyang website went on to warn that the public's anti-American sentiment will only further intensify as long as the U.S. interferes in inter-Korean relations. It also accused South Korea of blindly obeying the United States' arrogant and gangster-like acts. ""The authorities in South Korea should thoroughly implement inter-Korean joint declarations, instead of succumbing to the U.S., if they have a willingness to write a new history in inter-Korean relations,"" the website said. Meari, another propaganda website run by the North, denounced the resumption of the KMEP after a lapse of six months, saying the joint drill runs counter to the inter-Korean military agreement and threatens peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula.

No further dismantlement at NK missile site: 38 North ,2018-11-09 09:25,North Korea,,"North Korea's key missile site has not been dismantled further since August, a U.S. website monitoring the regime said Thursday. North Korea has pledged to dismantle a missile engine testing site and a launch pad in Dongchang-ri as part of its stated commitment to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. 38 North said satellite imagery from Oct. 31 indicates there has been no additional dismantlement activity since August. ""Components that were previously removed remain stacked on the ground at both locations,"" 38 North said in an article posted on its website. Meanwhile, the imagery shows new equipment, possibly for ventilation, installed on the roof of a fuel and oxidizer storage bunker at the site. ""While the new equipment seems to have been installed between June and July 2018, previous imagery until late October had insufficient detail to distinguish between partial roof demolition and new equipment installation,"" it said. The United States and North Korea have been in talks to implement an agreement reached by U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to work toward the ""complete"" denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in exchange for security guarantees from the U.S. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a top North Korean official had been scheduled to meet in New York on Thursday to continue the negotiations and plan a second summit between Trump and Kim. The talks were abruptly postponed due to what the U.S. said were scheduling issues. (Yonhap) "

Pompeo delays talks set this week with senior North Koreans ,2018-11-07 14:07,North Korea,,"A meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korean officials set for Thursday in New York has been postponed and will be rescheduled ""when our respective schedules permit,"" the U.S. State Department said on Wednesday. In a statement, it added, ""Ongoing conversations continue to take place,"" but did not elaborate. ""The United States remains focused on fulfilling the commitments agreed to by President Trump and Chairman Kim at the Singapore summit in June,"" it said. The exact reason for the postponement was unclear. Pompeo had been due to hold talks with senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol, which were hoped to have opened the way for a second summit of the two countries' leaders and make progress on denuclearization. The meeting agenda had been to ""discuss making progress on all four pillars of the Singapore Summit joint statement, including achieving the final, fully verified denuclearization"" of North Korea, the State Department had said this week. The June meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore was the first summit meeting of an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader. At that meeting, Kim Jong Un, who seeks relief from tough U.S.-led sanctions, committed to work toward denuclearization, but his steps since have fallen short of U.S. demands for irreversible moves to abandon a weapons program that potentially threatens the United States.

North Korea promotes inter-Korean summit symbols to attract tourists ,2018-11-07 12:00,North Korea,,"North Korea anxious to jack up its tourism revenue appears to be aggressively promoting the symbols of inter-Korean summit talks, such as Pyongyang cold noodles, the border peace village of Panmunjom and Mount Paekdu, to potential foreign tourists. JS Tours, a Japanese booking agent of the North's Korean International Travel Co., has launched North Korean tour packages featuring places jointly visited by the leaders of South and North Korea, American broadcaster Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported Wednesday. On its website, the Japanese agent advertises a three-night, four-day Pyongyang tour package that includes stops in the well-known Okryugwan and Chongryugwan restaurants, saying the restaurants offer original Pyongyang cold noodles, or ""naengmyeon"" in Korean. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, their wives and attendants ate naengmyeon at Okryugwan after an inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang in September. JS Tours has also offered a new five-night, six-day tour package bound for Mount Paekdu, saying Moon and Kim had a commemorative photo together at the Chonji crater lake on top of the North Korean mountain, according to RFA. A North Korean tourism industry official recently told the Chosun Sinbo that Panmunjom, where Moon and Kim held their first summit in April, is the most popular tourist destination in the North. The official estimated that the number of foreign visitors to Panmunjom is expected to more than double this year, due to tourists' curiosity for the inter-Korean border crossed by Kim. Tourism is considered one of the rare sources of foreign currency earnings for North Korea, which has been put under international economic sanctions. For that reason, the Pyongyang regime has recently been diversifying its tour package programs for foreigners to increase its tourism revenue. The North's Rodong Sinmun daily newspaper this week introduced Cuba's success as a popular tourist destination, noting the country aims to increase the number of foreign visitors from 4.7 million last year to 5 million this year.

Korea-Japan standoffs deepen over WWII forced labor ,2018-11-07 10:03,North Korea,,"A diplomatic spat between South Korea and Japan has intensified this week amid Tokyo's strong protest against a recent Seoul court ruling on the wartime forced labor issue. The two sides traded accusations against each other publicly. Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono opened fire again on Monday with a media interview in which he urged the South Korean government to resolve the problem. ""It's obvious: they are responsible for taking care of all the claims from the Korean people. So that's what they have to do,"" he told Bloomberg News. ""That's what's in the 1965 agreement."" He was referring to the pact between the two countries on ""the settlement of problems related to property, claims and economic cooperation"" over Japan's brutal colonization of Korea from 1910-45. Nearly 14 years ago, four South Koreans filed a damage suit against a Japanese steelmaker for their forced labor during World War II. The Supreme Court acknowledged their individual rights to compensation for the wartime crime against humanity. It ordered Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp., a Japanese steelmaker, to pay each victim 100 million won (US$88,000). The South Korean government said it respects the court ruling and vowed efforts to manage relations with Japan. Kono condemned Seoul's stance. ""It would be difficult for any country to do anything with the South Korean government"" if it nullifies a deal due to a court ruling, he said. South Korean officials were upset about Japan's response to the ruling. Vice Foreign Minister Cho Hyun met with Tokyo's Ambassador to Seoul Yasumasa Nagamine on Tuesday to deliver its message. Cho's ministry also issued a late-night statement accusing Japan of handling the court decision in a ""political, excessive"" manner. ""Our government is very concerned that Japan's responsible leaders are continuing remarks to provoke public sentiment in ignorance of the root cause of the problem associated with the Supreme Court's ruling this time,"" it said. The ministry said Japanese government officials are ""overreacting"" to the independent court ruling in a democracy. (Yonhap) "

Warmbiers' suit against North Korea begins next month ,2018-11-06 14:08,North Korea,,"By Lee Min-youngThe parents of Otto Warmbier, a U.S. college student who died after he was reportedly mistreated in a North Korean labor camp, will be in court next month as the trial of their lawsuit against the North Korean regime begins. According to a Voice of America (VOA) report on Tuesday, the U.S. federal court notified the Warmbiers that the first hearing will be held on Dec. 19. The Warmbiers filed the suit in April, accusing the North of violating international law by killing their son. The Warmbiers, Lee Sung-yoon, assistant professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and David Hawk, a member of the National Committee on North Korea, will testify at the trial.

Pompeo to meet North Korean counterpart in New York this week ,2018-11-05 10:02,North Korea,,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday he will meet this week in New York with North Korea's number two to discuss denuclearization and a possible second summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.""I expect we'll make some real progress, including an effort to make sure that the summit between our two leaders can take place where we can make substantial steps toward denuclearization,"" Pompeo said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""Pompeo's meeting with Kim Yong Chol later this week comes with the two sides at loggerheads nearly five months after a historic summit in June in which Trump and Kim pledged to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.North Korea's foreign ministry warned earlier in the week that Pyongyang will ""seriously"" consider reviving its nuclear weapons program unless US sanctions are lifted.Pompeo dismissed the statement, telling ""Fox News Sunday,"" ""I'm not worried about that.""""We are very focused. We know with whom we are negotiating, we know what their positions (are) and President Trump has made his position very clear,"" Pompeo said.He added that there would be ""no economic relief until we have achieved our ultimate objective.""News of the meeting, and the possibility of another summit, also comes just two days before crucial US midterm elections seen as a referendum on Trump.Trump has often pointed to the detente with North Korea -- the subject of saber-rattling rhetoric and soaring tensions early in his term -- as a signature foreign policy accomplishment.Pompeo emphasized in both television appearances that there have been no missile or nuclear tests since the summit in Singapore, and remains of US troops killed during the Korean War have been returned.""We've had success in just a handful of months since this past June, and we continue to make good progress. I'm confident that we'll advance the ball again this week when I'm in New York City,"" he said on CBS.But the progress has fallen well short of the promise of the summit, with Washington pushing to maintain sanctions against the North until its ""final, fully verified denuclearization,"" and Pyongyang condemning US demands as ""gangster-like.""""The improvement of relations and sanctions are incompatible,"" said the foreign ministry statement, released under the name of the director of the foreign ministry's Institute for American Studies. ""What remains to be done is the US corresponding reply,"" it added.Kim Yong Chol, Pompeo's counterpart in the talks, is a general, a former top intelligence chief and right-hand man to the North Korean leader.He visited the White House in the diplomatic run-up to the Singapore summit, and has been Pompeo's chief interlocutor in the months since.In mid-October, Pompeo evoked the possibility of a second summit, preceded by talks with Kim Yong Chol.""We're working on finding dates and times and places that will work for each of the two leaders,"" Pompeo said at the time.

North Korea threatens to resume nuke development over sanctions ,2018-11-04 09:06,North Korea,,"North Korea has warned it could revive a state policy aimed at strengthening its nuclear arsenal if the United States does not lift economic sanctions against the country. The statement released by the Foreign Ministry on Friday evening said North Korea could bring back its ''pyongjin'' policy of simultaneously advancing its nuclear force and economic development if the United States doesn't change its stance. The North sopped short of threatening to abandon ongoing nuclear negotiations with Washington. Still, it accused Washington of derailing commitments made by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump at their June summit in Singapore to work toward a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. It was the first time the North said it could potentially resume weapons tests and other development activities since Kim signaled a new state policy in April. In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he plans to talk next week with his North Korean counterpart, apparently referring to senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol. Pompeo did not provide the location and date for the meeting, which will likely be focused on persuading North Korea to take firmer steps toward denuclearization and setting up a second summit between their leaders. ''A lot of work remains, but I'm confident that we will keep the economic pressure in place until such time as Chairman Kim fulfills the commitment he made to President Trump back in June in Singapore,'' Pompeo said. The North Korean Foreign Ministry statement, released under the name of the director of the ministry's Institute for American Studies, said the ''improvement of relations and sanctions is incompatible.'' ''The U.S. thinks that its oft-repeated 'sanctions and pressure' leads to 'denuclearization.' We cannot help laughing at such a foolish idea,'' it said. The ministry described the lifting of U.S.-led sanctions as corresponding action to the North's ''proactive and good-will measures,'' apparently referring to its unilateral suspension of nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and closure of a nuclear testing ground. Following a series of provocative nuclear and missile tests last year, Kim shifted to diplomacy when he met with Trump between three summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who lobbied hard to revive nuclear diplomacy. However, the North has been playing hardball since the summits, insisting that sanctions should be lifted before any progress in nuclear talks, which fueled doubts about whether Kim would ever deal away a nuclear program he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival. Ahead of his first summit with Moon in April, Kim said the country should shift its focus to economic development as the ''pyongjin'' policy had achieved a ''great victory.'' He also declared that the North would stop nuclear and long-range missile tests. The North dismantled its nuclear testing ground in May, but didn't invite experts to observe and verify the event. ''If the U.S. keeps behaving arrogantly without showing any change in its stand, while failing to properly understand our repeated demand, the DPRK may add one thing to the state policy for directing all efforts to the economic construction adopted in April and as a result, the word 'pyongjin' may appear again,'' Friday's statement said, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ''Pyongjin'' means ''dual advancement.'' Moon has described inter-Korean engagement as crucial to resolving the nuclear standoff. A large number of South Korean CEOs accompanied Moon in his September visit to Pyongyang, when he and Kim agreed to normalize operations at a jointly run factory park and resume South Korean visitors' travel to the North when possible, voicing optimism the international sanctions could end and allow such projects. But South Korea's enthusiasm for engagement with its rival has also created discomfort in the United States amid growing concerns that the North is dragging its feet with its promise to denuclearize. South Korea last month walked back on a proposal to lift some of its unilateral sanctions against North Korea to create diplomatic space following Trump's blunt retort that Seoul could ''do nothing'' without Washington's approval.

Two Koreas declare intent to co-host 2032 Olympics ,2018-11-02 16:23,North Korea,,"South Korea and North Korea agreed on Friday to inform the International Olympic Committee (IOC) formally of their intention to co-host the 2032 Summer Games. The two sides reached that agreement during their sports talks in the North's border town of Kaesong. Following their first sports talks in four months, the Koreas issued a joint communique, detailing other areas of cooperation. The Koreas said they will try to field a joint team at next year's men's handball world championships. The Koreas also agreed to form unified teams at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics and to work with the IOC and international federations of summer Olympic sports to make that happen. And to ensure mutual growth in sports, the Koreas said they'll actively participate in international competitions held on either side of the border. The Koreas first expressed their interest in sharing the 2032 Olympics after the Sept. 19 summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. No Olympic Games, summer or winter, have been shared by two countries. IOC President Thomas Bach said at the time the IOC ""welcomes very much"" the intention of the two Koreas to jointly host the Olympics. And following Friday's agreement, the Koreas will now send a formal document to the IOC expressing their intention. Seoul's Vice Sports Minister Roh Tae-kang led the South Korean delegation and met with North Korean Vice Sports Minister Won Kil-u at the joint liaison office in Kaesong. Their meeting started at 10 a.m. The formal bidding process for the 2032 Olympics hasn't begun, and the IOC typically awards hosting rights seven years beforehand. Germany, Australia, India and Indonesia have expressed interest in the 2032 Olympics. After Tokyo in 2020, Paris will host the Summer Olympics in 2024, followed by Los Angeles in 2028. The Koreas have taken major steps in their sports cooperation. In February this year, the Koreas assembled a unified women's hockey team at the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea's PyeongChang. It was the first all-Korean team at any Olympics, winter or summer. They also marched in together at the opening ceremony. At the Asian Games in Indonesia in the summer, the Koreas had joint teams in rowing, canoeing and women's basketball and won a gold medal in dragon boat racing, a canoeing discipline. The Koreas have also competed as one at international table tennis events, with plans for more joint teams at upcoming competitions. (Yonhap) "
Sexual violence rampant in NK: report ,2018-11-01 17:16,North Korea,,"By Kim Jae-heunA report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), an international nongovernmental organization, revealed Thursday that government officials committin sexual violence is rampant in North Korea.The report, titled ""You Cry at Night but Don't Know Why': Sexual Violence against Women in North Korea,"" contains interviews with 106 North Korean defectors conducted between January 2015 and July 2018. Fifty-seven of them have defected after Kim Jong-un rose to power in 2011.According to the report, a large number of married women in North Korea had become exposed to sexual violence while working at marketplaces, where government officials exploit them sexually. Twenty-one women said they have either been sexually harassed or assaulted by government officials.According to one female defector, state regulators or security men would just tell women to follow them into an empty room or someplace else whenever they wanted. She said it happened so often that the officials did not think it was wrong and women became used to it.Sexual violence was more serious at detention facilities. Another woman said she was caught while trying to escape to China in 2009 and was detained in Chongjin. ""There was a woman who was consistently raped by the officer. Another officer would rape every new female prisoner,"" she said in the report.""If North Korean women had judicial means to deal with sexual violence, they would call out for a #MeToo movement, but their voices are silenced under the dictatorship of Kim,"" Kenneth Roth, executive director of the HRW, said during a press conference in central Seoul. ""We should not let North Korean officials rape women who are going out to work to support their family.

North Korean economist calls for expanding autonomy of enterprises,2018-10-29 17:15,North Korea,," By Jung Da-min  A Pyongyang economist on Monday called for changes in the regime's economic policies to expand the autonomy of enterprises and ensure the responsibility of workers.  North Korea's party mouthpiece Rodong Sinmun published the call in a column titled ""An important demand to carry on the new strategic route of the party"" by Ri Ki-song, a professor at North Korea's Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Economy, who has promoted the North Korean economy in interviews with foreign media.  Ri emphasized the importance of the ""socialist system of responsibility management of enterprises,"" saying that national economic policies should focus more on improving the achievements of enterprises and workers by giving them more autonomy and responsibility.  ""It is important to take strong and practical measures so that the socialist enterprises, the basic units of production and management, can demonstrate their responsibility, initiative and creativity, with the socialist system of responsibility management of enterprises having effects,"" Ri wrote.  ""Economic and legal conditions should be guaranteed and improved in a reasonable way, so that enterprises, by utilizing the given authority of management, can improve their business management.""  Since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took power, the country has been focusing on improving its economic management system as a key task in resolving economic problems.  ""The North Korean government is seeking various policy changes under the slogan of economic management improvement measures,"" said Lee Seog-ki, senior researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade (KIET)'s Center for Global Industry and Trade, in a report published in May.  According to the report, which deals with changes in North Korea's enterprise management system and the implications for inter-Korean economic cooperation, the country established and amended detailed regulations for the application of relevant economic laws in 2014 to enforce the socialist system of responsibility management of enterprises.  From the second half of 2014 to the first half of 2015, the country completed the legalization of the new economic management system by amending a series of laws on planning of people's economy, the country's finance and enterprises.  The new economic management system reflects North Korea's changed economic and market conditions to allow private investment and some private economic activities. The new system also strengthened the incentives for enterprises and workers while introducing more market functions. Lastly, it ensured autonomy and decision-making power of the enterprises while allowing their market activities.  ""In order to narrow the gap between the official corporate management system and the actual business operation methods and further to improve the performance of the statue-run enterprises by utilizing the market and enlarging the government finances, major revision of the planning system was needed,"" the report said.  Meanwhile, Ri also urged the country to strengthen its unique economic structure by implementing comprehensive and equal developments in industries including coal, thermal power, machinery, metal, chemical and light industry.  Ri also called for existing business sectors to be modernized while developing advanced technologies such as information technology, nanotechnology and biotechnology, while creating new high-tech industry sectors.

Ri Ki Song, a senior researcher with the Economic Institute of the North's Academy of Social Sciences, said that although sanctions aimed at getting his country to abandon its nuclear and missile programs have increased over the past year, the country's economy has maintained steady growth _ with its GDP increasing from $24.998 billion in 2013 to $29.595 billion in 2016 and $30.704 billion in 2017. Some outside experts dispute the North's statistics. An estimate released in July by South Korea's central bank, for example, had the North's GDP decreasing 3.5 percent in 2017, which would be its biggest contraction since the famine years of the late 1990s. Ri, who spoke with The Associated Press in Pyongyang last week, said the growth reflected how sanctions have resulted in some parts of the economy becoming more efficient and self-reliant. The North has developed a kind of fertilizer that uses domestically produced coal instead of imported oil products, and made improvements in the method of producing steel, he said. He did not mention the flowering of capitalist-style markets, which are still officially somewhat frowned upon but which many observers suspect is a major factor if the economy is indeed growing. Ri expressed optimism about the current climate of detente on the Korean Peninsula and leader Kim Jong Un's summits this year with Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump. ''We are seeing a lot of changes in the atmosphere surrounding our country,'' he said. He said that if sanctions were lifted and the political climate was to improve enough, the North could emulate countries like Switzerland and Singapore, ''which have few resources and little territory but have used their geographical location to their greatest advantage.''''We are situated in the center of East Asia, so our Korean Peninsula has a very advantageous geographical location,'' he said. ''In the future we will try to make cooperation with our neighboring countries to develop the transport industry. If we use our railways from the South through Siberia, many countries would prefer our rails to shipping by the seas.''That idea has been kicking around for years, if not decades. The North already has railroad links with Russia, China and South Korea, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in has publicly supported a plan to re-start cross-border rail operations as soon as possible. Even so, previous attempts to set the transportation hub scheme in motion have repeatedly fallen apart due to political friction or shortfalls in either investment or sustained interest.Before any of this could make much progress, Washington would have to ease up its ''maximum pressure'' of heavily sanctioning the North and punishing those who trade with it. While praising Kim's diplomatic initiatives, Trump has insisted that sanctions must stay in place until the North makes clear and concrete moves to denuclearize. Joining international financial institutions would open the door to badly needed development funds and economic expertise. South Korea's President Moon indicated recently that Kim has expressed an interest in joining the IMF or World Bank. But doing so would likely require structural reforms and a level of transparency that the North may not want to provide. When asked whether Pyongyang is ready to meet such requirements, Ri said only that the North currently makes its GDP statistics available and declined to comment further. He suggested instead that the ball is in the international institutions' court. ''Due to the sanctions and the moves of the hostile countries like the United States and Japan, our attempt to join the international organizations has not been realized so far,'' he added, noting that the North tried unsuccessfully to join the Asian Development Bank in the 1990s. ''If we can't even join the regional organization it will be much harder to join the international organization.""

"NK media reports on military talks with Seoul, omits outcome ",2018-10-27 16:20,North Korea,,"North Korea's state media on Saturday reported on general-level military talks with South Korea a day earlier but didn't mention the outcome of the meeting. North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that the general-level military talks were held for ""implementing the historic September Pyongyang Joint Declaration."" Friday's meeting was one of the follow-ups to the summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang last month. ""At the talks, both sides reviewed in an overall way the first-phase implementation of the military agreement attached to the 'September Pyongyang Joint Declaration,'"" the KCNA said in English. ""And they discussed the practical matters arising in the next-phase implementation and agreed to take necessary steps."" South and North Korea agreed to withdraw 11 border guard posts each by November and verify their removal the following month during general-grade military talks at the truce village of Panmunjom on Friday. The two sides also decided on the ""early"" establishment of a joint military committee tasked with enforcing their Sept. 19 military agreement aimed at reducing border tensions and preventing accidental clashes. The KCNA, however, did report that Major Gen. Kim Do-gyun led the South's delegation and the North was represented by Lt. Gen. An Ik-san. (Yonhap) "
US calls on UN to enforce sanctions on North Korea ,2018-10-27 10:02,North Korea,,"The United States on Friday called on the United Nations to fully comply with sanctions on North Korea until the regime gives up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert issued the call in a statement welcoming a U.N. committee's decision to deflag and ban port entry to three vessels suspected of engaging in illicit activities with the North. The Shang Yuan Bao, New Regent and Kum Un San 3 are accused of carrying out banned ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum to North Korean ships. ""North Korea's illicit imports of refined petroleum have substantially breached the U.N. sanctions cap on refined petroleum by making illicit transfers, and we urge that Member States immediately end all sales of refined petroleum to North Korea,"" the spokeswoman said. ""We call on the 1718 Committee to formally recognize this breach."" Nauert said the U.S. has deployed aircraft and surface vessels to detect and disrupt the illicit maritime activities. ""The U.S. remains committed to achieving the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea,"" she said. ""The full enforcement of North Korean-related U.N. Security Council Resolutions is crucial to a successful outcome. The international community must continue to enforce and implement U.N. Security Council Resolutions until North Korea denuclearizes."" The U.S. has vowed to maintain sanctions pressure on North Korea while also pushing diplomatic efforts to denuclearize the regime. U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are expected to hold a second summit early next year following their first one in Singapore in June. At the first summit, Kim committed to work toward ""complete"" denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in exchange for security guarantees from the U.S. (Yonhap) "
Seoul to open bank branches in North Korea only after sanctions are lifted ,2018-10-26 17:26,North Korea,,"South Korea will open bank branches in North Korea only after international sanctions are lifted in return for irreversible steps by the North to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, the top financial regulator here said Friday. Choi Jong-ku, chairman of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), told a parliamentary audit meeting that Seoul has not discussed cooperation with North Korea in the financial sector. ""Opening bank branches in North Korea will be possible only after conditions are met,"" Choi said. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to work to end the North's nuclear weapons program at a landmark summit in June, but there has been little progress on the details of how to meet that goal. The U.S. has called on its allies to maintain sanctions on North Korea until the North takes concrete and irreversible steps towards denuclearization. Financial sources have said the U.S. Treasury Department called on South Korean banks to comply with sanctions on North Korea, in a thinly veiled warning against doing business with Pyongyang before it takes irreversible steps toward denuclearization. The Treasury Department emailed several commercial and policy banks and conducted conference calls on Sept. 20 and 21, according to the sources. The state-run Korea Development Bank and the Industrial Bank of Korea received calls from the Treasury Department, along with Kookmin Bank, Shinhan Bank and Nonghyup Bank. (Yonhap) "
Koreas agree to demolish 22 guard posts ,2018-10-26 16:49,North Korea,,"Koreas agree to stop all hostile activities along the border from Nov. 1 By Kim Yoo-chul, Joint Press CorpsPANMUNJEOM/SEOUL _ The two Koreas agreed late Friday to completely demolish 22 front-line guard posts (GPs) by the end of November within the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating Seoul and Pyongyang, following a broad-reaching military agreement at President Moon Jae-in's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un last month to reduce tensions.Military generals of both sides held talks Friday at Tongilgak in the North's side of the truce village of Panmunjeom inside the DMZ. After, they released a joint statement saying they agreed to create a joint military committee to explore further measures to disarm and cut back military threats against each other.

South Korea pushes for inter-Korean joint volcano observatory at Mount Paekdu ,2018-10-26 15:09,North Korea,,"South Korea is pushing to set up an inter-Korean joint volcano observatory at Mount Paekdu on the North Korean-Chinese border, officials in Seoul said Friday. The Korea Meteorological Administration has drawn up a medium- and long-term plan to establish a facility to observe volcanic activities on the mountain, together with North Korea, according to administration officials and Rep. Sol Hoon of the ruling Democratic Party. The 2,744-meter-high mountain, the highest on the Korean Peninsula and considered a spiritual home of the Korean people, last erupted in 1903, historical records showed. The plan calls for the two Koreas to establish a joint observation station equipped with devices to detect seismic movements around Paekdu and communications networks, as well as facilities to measure the magnetic field of the earth and analyze volcanic gas, the officials and Sol said. ""Discussions with North Korea have yet to begin, but the joint observatory project will be pushed if the conditions are met,"" an administration official said. An eruption of Mount Paekdu is expected to cause immediate damage from pyroclastic flows that contain lava, gravel and stones before triggering secondary damage from the spread of volcanic ash, experts say.

"North Korea mass games a hit, get extended run in Pyongyang [PHOTOS] ",2018-10-26 10:51,North Korea,,"  North Korea has extended the run of its iconic mass games, which it revived last month to mark the country's 70th birthday. Despite a travel ban blocking tourists from the U.S. and pricey tickets for tourists from other countries, the games _ which involve tens of thousands of gymnasts, dancers and flip-card-wielding hordes in the stands _ appear to once again be a hit, filling Pyongyang's 150,000-seat May Day Stadium more than a month after they resumed to end a 5-year hiatus. For the past month, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the country's independence on Sept. 9, North Korea has been staging its latest version of the games, called ''The Glorious Country.'' Performances had been expected to conclude on Oct. 10. Ticket sales appear to be good _ the stadium was nearly full on Thursday, with many Chinese and some Japanese tourists _ despite a travel ban that has stopped American tourists from visiting and seats for foreigners and VIPs that begin at $110 and go up to nearly $900. The performances run about two hours and are divided into ''chapters'' that depict important ideas or stages in the growth of the nation. One of the highlights of this year's performance is a segment on Korean reunification that depicts leader Kim Jong Un greeting South Korean President Moon Jae-in for their historic summit earlier this year. The games have been criticized as an insouciant homage to authoritarianism, with the individual so totally melded into the larger whole and performing for the glorification of the leader. But they are also almost certainly one of the biggest examples of performance art ever undertaken. The previous iteration of the games received a world record for having more than 100,000 participants. North Korea first staged its mass games in 2002, when Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, was the country's leader. They continued almost without interruption on an annual basis until 2013. (AP) "

'North Korea ready to expand internet access' ,2018-10-24 17:28,North Korea,,"By Jung Da-minNorth Korea is a country where residents do not have free access to the internet, but the country's science-priority policies are leading to an expansion in the number of new users.On Aug. 31, the Korean Society for Internet Information (KSII), a South Korean institute focusing on information technology, published a paper written by five North Korean scholars, titled ""Improved Hybrid Symbiotic Organism Search Task-Scheduling Algorithm for Cloud Computing,"" on its website.This was the first time that a paper by North Korean scholars was published in a South Korean journal. The paper deals with how to speed up the processing of file storage in an internet-connected computer cloud through the latest artificial intelligence techniques.The academy told KBS that they received the article from the North through email, and North Korean scholars expressed their hope for joint inter-Korean research projects in the field of information technology (IT).Park Chan-mo, chancellor of Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), said this was evidence of a change in North Korea's policy toward promoting the country's science and IT technology.According to Park, although PUST is the only university in North Korea known for its internet access, other top universities there might also be allowing students to use it.""This year, Kim Chaek University of Technology launched its website in August, commemorating the 70th anniversary of its foundation,"" Park said, during a seminar on North Korea's information and communications technology (ICT) held Tuesday at the National Assembly. ""Kim Il Sung University started to run their own website about three to four years ago.""At the seminar hosted by Seoul National University of Science and Technology's Graduate school of Public Policy and Information Technology, Park said North Korea seemed to be expanding internet access to more students, citing the talks he had with officials at Kim Il Sung University.""They told me they were soon going to allow their students to access the internet, when I asked them three years ago,"" Park said.As a Korean-American professor, he traveled in North Korea for 17 years before a U.S. travel ban took effect last year. Since 2011, he has served as chancellor of PUST, the first inter-Korean joint private university established in 2010.""North Korea's software technology has reached a level comparable to that of developed countries and this has been proven at many international software and coding competitions,"" he noted.Among the North's award-winning programs is an artificial intelligence Go (known as Baduk in Korean) program ""Eunbyul,"" developed in 1997 by five technicians from the Korean Computer Center (KCC). The program won first prize at the Computer Go World Championships held by Japan's Foundation of Fusion of Science and Technology (FOST) in 1998 and from 2003 to 2006, consecutively.""If inter-Korean exchanges take place in the field of ICT, the hardware of South Korea and the software technology of North Korea will have great synergy,"" Park said. ""International sanctions on the regime and the overall gap between the two Koreas in levels of information communication technologies, however, would be hurdles in inter-Korean ICT exchanges."" "

Seoul cancels own military training ,2018-10-24 17:07,North Korea,,"By Lee Min-hyungSeoul is on track to reduce or cancel planned military drills in line with the ongoing inter-Korean tension-easing despite concerns the move may weaken defense readiness here.Last week, the Pentagon said Washington and Seoul will suspend their upcoming joint air defense exercise, Vigilant Ace, scheduled to take place in December, as part of a bargaining chip for North Korea to speed up its denuclearization.The decision came amid the rare peace gesture from Pyongyang which has in recent months urged Seoul and Washington to stop their joint annual drills. The regime has viewed such joint drills as a potential security threat, calling it the biggest stumbling block to prevent inter-Korean reconciliation.Aside from the Seoul-Washington joint drills, South Korea has also decided to cancel its own military training. The biannual drill, taking place on the South's East Sea area, was supposed to take place next month, but the military decided to cancel it following an inter-Korean military agreement last month.Under the agreement, South Korea set a buffer zone spanning 80 kilometers in the East Sea, as part of efforts to alleviate maritime military tension with North Korea.""Starting from Nov. 1, South Korea cannot conduct a planned exercise there due to the military agreement,"" a government official said, asking for anonymity.

South Korean business people to visit now-suspended factory park in North Korea: official ,2018-10-24 11:34,North Korea,,"South Korean business people who ran factories in the Kaesong Industrial Complex are pushing to visit the now-suspended industrial park in the North Korean border town next week at the earliest, a government official said Wednesday. Baek Tae-hyun, a spokesman of the Ministry of Unification, said that the Seoul government is discussing with North Korea details of the South Korean business owners' visit to Kaesong. ""The business owners need to visit the Kaesong Industrial Complex to protect their property rights and inspect their assets. Discussions with the North are still underway, and the schedule has yet to be fixed,"" Baek said in a media briefing. In this regard, ministry officials said about 150 business people are expected to make single-day trips to Kaesong in small groups for three days starting Oct. 31. Baek then stressed that the business owners' planned visit to Kaesong is only aimed at protecting their property rights and has nothing to do with the resumption of the industrial park. He explained that the Kaesong visit has been pushed in accordance with an inter-Korean summit agreement signed in Pyongyang last month. Minister of Unification Cho Myoung-gyon also told the National Assembly early this month that the government was discussing the South Korean business people's visit to Kaesong separately from the reopening of the North's industrial park. The government of former President Park Geun-hye abruptly announced the closure of the Kaesong park on Feb. 10, 2016, in retaliation for the North's fourth nuclear weapons test and long-range missile launch. Since then, the South Korean owners of Kaesong factories have never set foot in the North Korean industrial complex, though they have applied for a visit to the North's border town six times. President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un agreed in their September summit to normalize the Kaesong Industrial Park and South Koreans' tour of the North's Mount Kumgang as soon as conditions are met. Meanwhile, the Committee for Emergency Measures for Kaesong Industrial Complex has begun relevant preparations for the Kaesong visit. A committee official said the number of Kaesong visitors is expected to reach 150 people, including representatives of 123 firms that ran factories in Kaesong and 30 support facilities, such as convenience stores and restaurants. The official said the visitors will likely be divided into six teams, each of which will be around 26 people, and one each will go to the Kaesong park in the morning and the afternoon for three days.

South Korea seeks high-profile joint military committee with North Korea ,2018-10-24 10:22,North Korea,,"South Korea's defense ministry plans to propose to North Korea that vice minister-level officials head a joint military committee to be formed to carry out a set of tension reduction measures agreed to at last month's summit, officials said Wednesday. The South will put forward details of its offer, including the level of the co-chair of the envisioned panel, when their Army generals meet each other at Panmunjom on Friday. ""(We) will discuss the formation and operation of the joint military committee during the general-level talks,"" the ministry official said. The committee would be in charge of overseeing the implementation of a set of tension-reducing measures in the Sept. 19 Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA). The South will recommend Vice Defense Minister Suh Choo-suk as its top delegate to the committee. It hopes that his counterpart will be Army Gen. So Hong-chan, first vice minister of the People's Armed Forces. It remains uncertain whether the North will choose So, as he also serves as director of the military's general logistics department, a post not directly related to military diplomacy or inter-Korean relations. Kim Hyong-ryong, another vice defense minister, is in charge of the issue. But he is a three-star general, which may cause a controversy over the formal status of Suh's counterpart. The two Koreas first agreed to create such a joint military committee in 1992, but they have yet to launch it amid tumultuous inter-Korean ties. (Yonhap) "
UN expert says North Korea's rights abysmal despite summits ,2018-10-24 09:50,North Korea,,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's summits with the presidents of South Korea and the United States have not changed his country's abysmal human rights record, the U.N. independent investigator on human rights in the isolated Asian nation said Tuesday. Speaking at a news conference, Tomas Ojea Quintana said he is ''very concerned'' that statements following Kim's meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump made no mention of human rights in North Korea. He pointed to reports of ''systematic, widespread abuses'' of human rights and a U.N. commission of inquiry's findings in 2014 that possible crimes against humanity have been committed in North Korea. ''The human rights situation at the moment, at the moment, has not changed,'' Quintana said. Quintana said dealing with North Korea's nuclear arsenal is extremely important for humanity, and he strongly supported rapprochement between the two Koreas and talks with the U.S. that have decreased tensions and improved prospects for peace. But he stressed that North Korea's human rights record must not be ignored. Quintana recalled that in his previous job as U.N. investigator in Myanmar, he raised alarm about ''crimes against humanity'' being committed by the military during that country's political transition in 2012 but his concerns were put aside. ''And now we see the consequences,'' he said, alluding to findings of military abuses against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority. He said he isn't saying the situation in North Korea is the same, but ''we shouldn't undermine the principle of human rights because sooner or later it will come back.'' ''As the process of rapprochement and talks are moving so fast, we the human rights people _ we also need to move fast and bring proposals, different proposals,'' Quintana said. He said one of his proposals is to ask the new U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, to initiate ''a process of engagement'' with North Korea. He also urged North Korea ''to show commitment to the human rights agenda'' and allow him to visit the country and talks to its leaders. Quintana, a human rights lawyer from Argentina appointed by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council, was in New York to present his latest findings to the U.N. General Assembly's human rights committee. He said he proposed to North Korean officials in Geneva last March that the government should start releasing political prisoners as a signal of commitment to human rights. ''We saw in the media there was an amnesty by the leadership and some prisoners were released,'' Quintana said. ''That was very important news.'' But Quintana added that when he wrote to North Korea seeking details, he got no response. He said in response to a question that the Trump administration has told him it supports his work and backs a General Assembly resolution condemning North Korea's human rights situation. On Monday, North Korea's official KCNA news agency accused ''some dishonest forces including Japan'' of ''working hard to cook up'' a politicized resolution on human rights. It called the annual resolution the result of a ''conspiratorial and criminal scenario of the hostile forces to defame'' North Korea. KCNA said Western countries should not be held up as ''the human rights standard of the world,'' saying that ''misanthropy and abnormal way of life are rampant'' in the West. (AP) "
Voyage home from North Korea,2018-10-23 17:38,North Korea,," This is the third in a three-part series about travel in North Korea.  By Jon Dunbar  Where are you if, to go home, you have to travel in the opposite direction?  This is the story of how the 195-kilometer distance from Pyongyang to Seoul became a 1,022-kilometer journey taking 27 hours, four trains, three buses, one taxi, one random Chinese couple's car, one airplane, two border crossings and six beers.  Additionally, I was dressed in North Korean clothes the whole way.  I visited the tailor at the Yanggakdo Hotel in Pyongyang, to make my ""Yanggakdo leisure suit."" Ever since my 2010 visit, I wanted to get a North Korean suit made. You might be thinking of a severe black high-collared ""Mao suit"" befitting an authoritarian look. But I had vivid memories of the leisure suit. North Korean men wearing short-sleeved suits, something I'd never seen before which struck me as humble and unpretentious.  The morning of my departure, I separated from my group. I'd chosen the four-day tour operated by the Canadian-run Paektu Cultural Exchange to see Pyongyang and Kaesong, and the others were on a 10-day trip, with visits to Wonsan and Mount Paektu.  My Korean guides complimented me on my suit and one took a picture on her smartphone. They dropped me off at Pyongyang Station, an impressive structure built in 1958. One guide seated me inside the crowded station and left abruptly. I wondered if he'd abandoned me now that I was essentially no longer his responsibility, but he came back a few minutes later to stay with me until the train departed.   From here on out, I was going solo.  Pyongyang was once a stop on the Gyeongui Line built in 1904. But the Gyeongui Line was split in 1948, and today the North operates the Pyongui (Pyongyang-Sinuiju) and Pyongbu (theoretically Pyongyang-Busan, but really Pyongyang-Kaesong) lines, while the South has the Gyeongui Line connecting Seoul with Dorasan Station at the DMZ. Soon this historic train route may be reconnected.  But for now, I was headed the opposite direction, up through Sinuiju to Dandong, China. After about four hours, in the distance loomed tall buildings. There was China, visible from Korean soil. Apparently Sinuiju citizens grew up in comparative affluence across the river from the less-developed Dandong. But the past couple decades changed that as Dandong built rapidly, it left an uncomfortable psychological effect on the Korean locals.  The whole time, I was anxious about the border crossing. My camera battery had died, and if the border guards wanted to inspect my photos, things would get difficult. On my customs form I overdeclared, mentioning my two cameras, as well as purchases from North Korea including foodstuffs, books and the shirt on my back. It made for good conversation with the border guard, anyway. We sat crammed in the train compartments for about two hours before the train rolled through and crossed the Yalu River.   We were out of North Korea, but the hard part was still to come. During my 2010 trip the transit in China had been the most stressful parts. China compared to Korea ― either Korea ― feels lawless, and every minor financial transaction becomes a hot-tempered argument. I even recall being turned away from hotels despite having reservations, for incomprehensible reasons. The air quality, especially in Shenyang, is so awful you can taste it whenever you open your mouth.  Once I left the train station, I got lost looking for the bus to Shenyang Airport. Finally I found a taxi driver who knew some Korean words, and he brought me to the bus station. Only it was closed.  Drenched in sweat and carrying four heavy bags, I rushed back into the train station to catch the Shenyang-Dandong Intercity Railway. Back in 2010, it was a lumbering old train that took several hours, but today it was a super-modern train boasting speeds up to 250 km/h. People stared at this sweaty foreigner dressed in a North Korean suit, probably unsure what to think.  I heard an attendant speak some basic Korean words, which came as a huge comfort on my journey between the Koreas. But I couldn't understand the cultural context and intent in using the words.  About an hour into the 208-kilometer journey, we got an announcement the next stop was Shenyangnan Station. Was that my stop? I hurried to the Korean-speaking attendant.  Turns out Shenyang has two train stations and two airports. They ushered me off at Shenyangnan, which turned out to be in the middle of nowhere, and told me to follow a man who clearly wasn't a rail employee.  What's more, he told me the airport hotel where I had a reservation was about 30 minutes away, about the same distance from the other Shenyang Station. But, he assured me, I won't have to pay for a taxi this way. There were no taxis out here anyway.  We loaded into a compact car with his wife and headed out. I looked out for road signs pointing toward the airport, but saw none for the first 20 minutes. Soon enough they dropped me off in front of the airport hotel.  These people had not picked me up for free language lessons like I would expect in the South, nor were they interested in harvesting my organs or selling me into slavery. We never exchanged names, but their kindness undid some of my negative thoughts about China.  My hotel reservation this time was valid, and with the great wealth of Chinese money I had left, I splurged on instant noodles and Chinese beer in the hotel store, falling asleep in my room before I could finish it all.  Next morning, I caught a flight back to Incheon, still wearing my Yanggakdo leisure suit. I temporarily took off the jacket while passing through customs.  I worried people here would get upset at it, but few South Koreans know how they dress in the North. Still, there may be anti-communist conservatives or people living here from the North who might take issue, so I don't wear it in public often.  Once I was out of the airport, I grabbed a beer from the nearest convenience store, confirming that, yes, South Korean beer really is the worst after a week of Taedonggang and smaller breweries' fare.  On the train back to Seoul, I looked around at all the people wasting their lives looking at their smartphones, and I sneered at a blandly colored ""I Want"" apartment complex we passed.  Finally I reached the end of my journey in Seoul, a journey that a few like me have taken, and many could never do.  "
Moon ratifies Pyongyang Declaration ,2018-10-23 16:59,North Korea,,"By Kim Yoo-chulPresident Moon Jae-in ratified an agreement signed between him and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at their third summit in Pyongyang last month. ""Moon ratified the Pyongyang Joint Declaration. An official announcement will soon follow,"" a Cheong Wa Dae official said.As a procedural step for the ratification, the Cabinet earlier approved the declaration, as well as a separate inter-Korean military agreement reached at the summit. The move comes after the Ministry of Government Legislation concluded that obtaining the National Assembly's consent for ratification of the two agreements was not necessary as a broader inter-Korean agreement, the Panmunjom Declaration reached at the first Moon-Kim summit in April, is undergoing the Assembly ratification process.The conservative parties sharply criticized the move, claiming Moon was backtracking on his earlier pledge to seek parliamentary consent for inter-Korean deals.However, the presidential office said the ratification of the two agreements will boost the wider implementation of promises made in Pyongyang.""At the Vatican, Pope Francis directly mentioned his willingness to visit North Korea. The U.K. and France, permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), clearly showed their backing in terms of denuclearization as well as the peace process. The international community is on our side. I hope to win more support from the public in the ongoing process,"" Moon said at the Cabinet meeting, according to press pool reports. The two Korea are engaging in military trust-building, the President said. ""Once we see further progress in the easing of military tensions and the development of inter-Korean relations, then the whole denuclearization process will accelerate,"" Moon said, adding the agreement will also help promote human rights in North Korea. The promises made at Panmunjeom in April and Pyongyang in September face the difficulties of the limits of economic cooperation under the extensive international sanctions regime on North Korea, and the issue of denuclearization.At the summit in Pyongyang, two detailed areas of progress were bilateral measures along the Northern Limit Line (NLL) _ the disputed West Sea maritime boundary _ and others along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).For President Moon, who has long been vocal about the pursuit of a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, walking away from the North Korean capital with a meaningful joint declaration on military-to-military talks and cooperation was a powerful gesture given the ongoing hurdles facing any further grand economic moves.Presidential chief of staff Im Jong-seok said the government plans to ask the National Assembly for ratification only if some agreements reached by the two Korea produce a financial burden. Unifying the two Koreas could cost $1 trillion under the best scenario and take several decades. The final price tag will depend largely on what the catalyst for reunification is.""As seen by previous cases, it's unnecessary for Assembly approval to make the Pyongyang Declaration actually happen,"" Im said after the Cabinet meeting, the pool reports said.President Moon is taking steps to spread his ""sanctions-relief"" message to the international community, to encourage North Korea to announce more concrete and detailed plans to scrap all its nuclear programs. The pitch, however, is getting a mixed response from UNSC members and the United States over ""differing thinking"" toward the North's denuclearization.The ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) welcomed the Cabinet's decision. The conservative opposition parties were less positive, claiming President Moon was disregarding the National Assembly.

North Korea issues stamps marking Moon-Kim summits [PHOTOS] ,2018-10-23 16:06,North Korea,,"By Jung Da-min, Park Si-soo North Korea has issued four sets of stamps commemorating the three inter-Korean summits this year ― on April 27, May 26 and Sept. 18-20 ― the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Monday.Their price ranges from 70 to 140 North Korean won, higher than the 40-50 won stamps issued to mark the North's 70th anniversary of its foundation.

Rodong Sinmun highlights 'anti-capitalism' campaigns in South Korea,2018-10-22 15:42,North Korea,," By Jung Da-min  North Korea's party mouthpiece Rodong Sinmun ran a series of articles on South Korea's political situation in its Monday edition, suggesting social rights of the disadvantaged, including workers and disabled, are being neglected in the South. The articles cited South Korean media's recent reports.  Out of the six articles about South Korea in the newspaper's page for foreign affairs, one article highlighted a South Korean civic group's recent press conference that denounced Yoosung Enterprise for destroying trade unions.  The conflicts between the workers and the management started in 2011 when the company established a separate trade union to overcome workers' requests to reduce working hours. Although the Supreme Court sentenced a Chairman Yoo Shi-young to 14 months' jail last December, workers have continued to demand direct negotiations with management.  At another press conference in Monday morning in front of the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, Seoul, the workers said Yoosung Enterprise's discrimination against workers, including wage reductions, was continuing.  The article in Rodong had been released a day earlier in the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).  Rodong's Monday edition also ran two other articles from KCNA ― one from a Saturday report on an assault at a special education school for the disabled in Seoul; the other from a Wednesday report on the South's minor progressive Minjung Party's separate organization of ""the poor,"" newly formed on Oct. 12 to fight for rights of underprivileged.  While North Korean media highlights the minor progressive party's recent activity suggesting the North's support for ""anti-capitalism"" campaigns in the South, they continued to slam the South's conservatives, especially the main opposition Liberty Korea Party (LKP).  Rodong's Monday edition ran an editorial titled ""Anti-unification groups' unedifying complaints"" to condemn the LKP for disrupting the progress of the Panmunjeom Declaration that came after the April 27 inter-Korean summit.  Meanwhile, the newspaper also ran articles on the South's Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union's fight to be recognized as a legitimate organization, as well as on the South's organizations' ""anti-U.S."" rallies condemning the U.S. for infringing on the South's sovereignty by intervening in inter-Korean affairs.

Why North Korean newspaper highlights US-China trade feud? ,2018-10-22 12:11,North Korea,,"North Korea's official newspaper again ran an article on the escalating conflict between the United States and China on Monday, citing expert opinions critical of Washington.The Rodong Sinmun, the organ of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, said in a commentary that confrontations between Washington and Beijing, which were caused by the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on each other, have been spreading to various other areas.The newspaper then said that U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's open criticism of China in his recent address and ensuing refutation from Beijing has further worsened the American-Chinese relationship.In his address to the Hudson Institute on Oct. 4, Pence accused Beijing of ""employing a whole-of-government approach, using political, economic and military tools, as well as propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its interests in the U.S.""He also raised suspicion that China was trying to exert influence and interfere in the U.S. domestic policy and politics, and leveled criticism at Beijing's policy for the South China Sea and suppression of ethnic minorities.China has responded sensitively and refuted Pence's remarks, raising fears that the China-U.S. conflict triggered by a trade war was escalating in many other areas.The Rodong Sinmun then cited views of some experts who are critical of the U.S.""Experts have raised concern about the escalation of the American-Chinese conflict and shared the view that America's capabilities to suppress China are limited and the trade dispute will certainly cause losses to itself,"" the newspaper said.Noting Washington's recent indictment of a Chinese spy, the Pyongyang newspaper quoted experts as saying that the strategic confrontation and friction between China and the U.S. that originated from a trade dispute has spread to various areas, including politics, human rights and cyberspace.The newspaper reported on Oct. 9 that the U.S. and Russia were escalating a conflict over Washington's plan to establish a military base in Poland.In addition, the North Korean media have steadily carried reports on strategic U.S. conflicts with China and Russia. Watchers speculate Pyongyang appears to be closely following Washington's relationship with Beijing and Moscow due to its potential impact on the North-U.S. denuclearization negotiations.North Korea, China and Russia recently issued a joint statement calling on the U.S. to ease sanctions on Pyongyang in return for its denuclearization measures.

Command will hold the second round of their working-level talks Monday over disarming the Joint Security Area (JSA) in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), Seoul's defense ministry said.The trilateral talks are set to take place at the Freedom House, a South Korea-controlled building at the truce village of Panmunjom inside the DMZ at 10 a.m.The two Koreas agreed to disarm the JSA under the military agreement their countries' defense chiefs signed during the third summit between President Moon Jae-in and the North's leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang last month. The UNC overseas activities inside the DMZ.""This meeting is aimed at checking and evaluating the status of demining operations at the JSA and consulting over schedules for withdrawing firearms and guard posts and adjusting guard personnel, as well as future plans for mutual verifications,"" the ministry said in a press release.The South and North will be represented by Army Col. Cho Yong-geun and Army Col. Om Chang-nam, respectively. The UNC's delegation will be headed by U.S. Army Col. Burke Hamilton, the Military Armistice Committee secretary. Separately, the two Koreas' militaries decided to hold general-grade talks to discuss the enforcement of their recent military agreement at Tongilgak, a North Korean building in Panmunjom on Friday.Seoul first made the proposal for the talks, which Pyongyang later accepted, Seoul officials said. Major Gen. Kim Do-gyun will lead South Korea's delegation, while the North Korean side will be represented by Lt. Gen. An Ik-san.The military agreement entails a series of measures to reduce tensions, prevent accidental clashes and build mutual trust. They include setting up air, ground and maritime buffer zones, withdrawing some border guard posts and disarming the JSA. (Yonhap) "
'North Korea seeks to escape isolation by inviting Pope' ,2018-10-21 17:47,North Korea,,"By Lee Min-hyung By Lee Min-hyung  With North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inviting Pope Francis to visit his regime, Pyongyang's failed attempts to invite a former pontiff are resurfacing here.

Koreas to hold 1st meeting in liaison office on Oct. 22 ,2018-10-21 16:40,North Korea,,"By Park Ji-wonThe first inter-Korean high-level meeting will be held at the newly opened liaison office in the North on Monday to discuss ways to tackle pest control for pine trees and the modernization of seedling farms in North Korea. It is the first time for the two Koreas to hold such a meeting there since its official opening on Sept. 14. High-ranking officials of the two Koreas agreed last week to hold further meetings to discuss cooperation in many areas.On Oct. 15, the two Koreas reached an agreement to hold talks about forests, welfare and medical care, sports and the Red Cross sometime between October and November on the sidelines of inter-Korean high-level talks. They agreed on starting a joint inspection for reconnecting railways and roads at the end of October.During the talks about forests they agreed to hold on Monday, the two Koreas are expected to discuss forming a new tree nursery in the North and long-term plans for reforestation of the North. Little data is available on the exact condition of North Korea's forestry, but it is said the lack of trees is severe there due to excessive deforestation, increasing the risks of flooding, landslides and desertification.According to the Ministry of Unification, the South Korean delegation will be led by Park Chong-ho, a senior official at the Korea Forest Service, and include Lim Sang-seop, chief of the Forest Industry & Policy Bureau, and Kim Hoon-ah, an official of the unification ministry.The North delegation will be led by Kim Song-jun, vice chief of the Ministry of Land and Environment Protection, and include Choe Bong-hwan, vice bureau chief of the land ministry, and Son Ji-myong, an official of the Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation Committee.Since the Panmunjeom Declaration signed between the two Koreas in April, high-ranking officials from both countries have held working-level talks on forestry cooperation in July and inspected the extent of diseases and pests on Mount Geumgang in the North in April.Both sides have been seeking cooperation on reforestation as it is one of the fields that is not in violation of U.N. sanctions on North Korea.In that context, the South Korean government pushed plans to give aid to the North in forestry by forming a taskforce to conduct forestry cooperation as one of the top priorities among projects with North Korea.The talks about welfare and medical services will be held on Oct. 24.Both the South and North had agreed on cooperation on welfare after the Oct. 4 declaration in 2007. However, the agreement has yet to materialize.The two are also expected to hold working-level talks about sports exchanges to push for joint participation in the 2020 Summer Olympics and co-hosting the 2032 Summer Olympics, but they haven't finalized their schedules to decide on the details.

Koreas to start joint inspection of western railway as early as this week ,2018-10-21 11:12,North Korea,,"South and North Korea are likely to start their joint on-site inspection as early as this week for a project to modernize and re-link railways across their border, government officials said Sunday. At high-level talks last week, the two Koreas agreed to begin field surveys of the western Gyeongui railway in late October and the Donghae railway along their east coast in November. ""The Koreas are known to be discussing ways to conduct the inspection (on the North section) of the Gyeongui line starting late this week,"" a government official said. ""The schedule is flexible, depending on consultations between the government and the United Nations Command (UNC) over the passage of the Military Demarcation Line,"" he added. In August, the Koreas failed to carry out a joint railway field survey as the U.S.-led UNC did not approve the plan, citing ""procedural"" problems, a move widely seen as U.S. objection to the inter-Korean railway project on the basis that it might hamper sanctions. ""As far as I'm concerned, Seoul's consultations with Pyongyang as well as the UNC are smoothly under way,"" the official said. If launched, the joint inspection will involve the test operation of a train on the railway linking Seoul to the North's northwestern city of Sinuiju. After that, the Koreas will check the eastern railway on the North's side that connects Mout Kumgang to its northeastern North Hamgyong province. South and North Korea are looking to hold a ground-breaking ceremony for work on the rail and road systems along the eastern and western regions either in late November or early December. Meanwhile, the two Koreas plan to hold working-level talks starting this week to implement agreements of the inter-Korean summit held in Pyongyang last month. On Monday, they will hold talks at a joint liaison office in the North's border town of Kaesong to discuss ways to promote forestry cooperation and to control pine tree pests. Park Chong-ho, deputy minister of the state-run Korea Forest Service, will lead the South's three-member delegation, according to Seoul's unification ministry. His North Korean counterpart is Kim Song-jun, a senior official at the North's ministry of environmental protection. In October, the Koreas are also scheduled to have health-related talks on curbing the spread of contagious diseases and sports talks to discuss co-hosting of the 2032 Summer Olympics. (Yonhap) "
South Korea's nuke envoy heads to US over NK nuclear issue ,2018-10-21 10:09,North Korea,,"South Korea's top nuclear envoy left for the United States on Sunday to coordinate North Korea policy with Washington, Seoul's foreign ministry said. Lee Do-hoon, the country's representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, will visit Washington D.C. from Sunday to Tuesday to meet with his U.S. counterpart, Stephen Biegun. They are expected to discuss the progress of negotiations between the United States and North Korea, including preparations for a second summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday said he hopes to meet with his North Korean counterpart ""in the next week and a half or so"" to continue planning for the summit between their leaders. ""There are various dialogues and contacts under way between the U.S. and North Korea. I'll meet with Biegun to listen to Washington's plan and consult on how to push for the denuclearization (of the Korean Peninsula),"" Lee told reporters at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul. He said that denuclearization should be pursued on the basis of the Seoul-Washington alliance and with international support. As for potential talks between Biegun and North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, Lee said it is a matter of when such a meeting will be held, not whether it would be held. Pompeo made his fourth visit to Pyongyang earlier this month in an effort to revive stalled denuclearization talks with North Korea. The North is calling on the U.S. to declare an end to the 1950-53 Korean War and soften sanctions in response to Pyongyang's measures such as the demolition of its nuclear test site. But the U.S. demands more concrete steps toward denuclearization -- for example, the listing of its nuclear weapons. The two nuclear envoys may also exchange views on South Korea's hope that the U.S. could exempt inter-Korean cooperative projects from sanctions, diplomatic sources said. At high-level talks held last Monday, South and North Korea agreed to start a joint project to modernize and eventually connect their railways and roads across their borders in late November or early December. Washington remains cautious about inter-Korean economic cooperation, saying that any advancement in inter-Korean ties should be tied to progress on North Korea's denuclearization. Lee and Biegun will likely also share the outcome of their respective visits to China and Russia, as well as to Europe. The nuclear envoys have recently held a series of meetings in Seoul and New York to coordinate the allies' policy on North Korea. (Yonhap) "
Moon heads home with European concessions for North Korea ,2018-10-21 09:38,North Korea,,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in headed home Saturday, wrapping up a five-nation European tour that was apparently more successful than anticipated, heralding the possibility of a trip by Pope Francis to North Korea. In a meeting with the pope held in the Vatican on Thursday, President Moon delivered an invitation from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for the pope to visit Pyongyang. The pope gave conditional but implicit agreement, saying he will be ""available"" for the trip. ""(I) will unconditionally give an answer if an (official) invitation arrives,"" the pope was quoted as telling Moon through his interpreter. Moon's trip began last Saturday when he arrived in Paris on a four-day state visit. There, he also sought to win concessions for the impoverished North, stressing the need for the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) to consider easing its sanctions against the North when and if the communist state's denuclearization process reaches a point of no return. President Emmanuel Macron of France emphasized the need to maintain international sanctions on the North to completely, verifiably and irreversibly denuclearize the country, but said his country will support ways to further accelerate the denuclearization process if North Korea is in fact moving in that direction. France is one of five permanent members of the UNSC. Moon also asked for Britain's support for his peace initiative in his bilateral summit with British Prime Minister Theresa May, held on the sidelines of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit on Friday. May agreed on the need to come up with ways to help accelerate the North's denuclearization process while urging Pyongyang to prove its commitment to complete denuclearization with more concrete actions, according to Moon's presidential office Cheong Wa Dae. Moon's departure from Copenhagen, the last leg of his five-nation trip, which also took him to Rome, came after he attended the inaugural summit of the Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030, or P4G. There, he stressed the importance of joint efforts by both the public and private sectors to address major global challenges, such as poverty and climate change. The South Korean president is set to arrive home Sunday (Seoul time). (Yonhap) "
Koreas consider forming joint wrestling team at Tokyo Olympics ,2018-10-20 19:21,North Korea,,"South and North Korea are considering forming a joint wrestling team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, Seoul's wrestling governing body said Saturday. Korea Wrestling Federation (KWF) said its competition director, Lee Joong-sub, and the North Korean wrestling body secretary general, Kim Il, met Thursday in Budapest, where the 2018 World Wrestling Championships is being held, and exchanged opinions on forming a joint wrestling team at the 2020 Olympics. ""Although it's not confirmed that we're going to have a joint team, both sides have exchanged their ideas in a good atmosphere,"" a KWF offical said. ""The two Koreas also touched on holding joint training in Seoul and Pyongyang."" According to the KWF, United World Wrestling President Nenad Lalovic also promised his support for the joint Korean team at the Olympics. The two Koreas previously trained together during the 18th Asian Games in Indonesia this summer, but didn't compete as one team. Expectations are high for the South and the North to have many joint teams at the next Olympics. Following the third inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang in September, the two Koreas announced in their joint declaration that they will seek ways to compete together in international sports competitions. The KWF said it will have further discussions with North Korea on forming the joint wrestling team. ""South Korea is better in Greco-Roman wrestling than North Korea, but North Korea is stronger in freestyle wrestling,"" a KWF official said. ""We believe that forming joint teams will help both sides upgrade their competitiveness."" But unlike other sports in which the two Koreas have had joint teams, wrestling doesn't have a team competition, meaning the officials will have a hard time dealing with Olympic quota issues and other entry problems.

North Korea's birth rate remains below replacement level ,2018-10-19 19:50,North Korea,,"By Jung Da-minGlobal trends towards smaller families and low birth rates are also being seen in North Korea, according to the United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) ""State of World Population 2018"" report, released Wednesday.The report said the ""total fertility rate (TFR)"" in North Korea stood at 1.9 this year and remained below the replacement rate of 2.1, required to maintain a stable population in the country.

North Korea strengthens regional ties on Workers' Party foundation anniversary ,2018-10-18 16:28,North Korea,,"By Jung Da-minNorth Korea is committed to strengthening its regional ties in Asia, especially with traditional allies such as China, Russia and Mongolia, on the 73rd anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK).The country's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) recently published a series of articles on diplomatic and cultural events involving these countries. This is in contrast with last year when North Korea was isolated from the international community after conducting missile and nuclear tests. In particular, North Korea-China relations had been weakened to the point where the regime's state media did not even report China's congratulatory message for the event. On the Oct. 10 foundation anniversary this year, however, the KCNA reported that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese Embassy in North Korea sent floral baskets to the WPK Central Committee.On Tuesday, the embassy hosted a friendly gathering attended by North Korean officials including Ri Su-yong, a member of the Political Bureau and vice-chairman of the WPK Central Committee.According to the KCNA report, Ri watched an art performance by the Shenzen City Art Troupe together with Chinese Ambassador Li Jinjun and talked about ""the need to expand and develop bilateral relations at a new level.""This year, North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un met Chinese President Xi Jinping in March, May and June, indicating an unwavering alliance between the countries.On Wednesday, North Korea's party mouthpiece, the Rodong Sinmun, published a rare travel report by a North Korean journalist who visited China to trace historic sites related to North Korea-China friendly relations.Meanwhile, North Korea is expected to boost its alliance with Russia, with Moscow confirming that President Vladimir Putin will meet Kim this year, although details have yet to be discussed. The meeting would mark the first summit between the two leaders.In addition, North Korean media reports on exchanges with Mongolia have particularly increased, highlighting former leader Kim Il-sung's efforts to boost relations between the countries. Kim Il-sung visited Mongolia in 1956 and 1988.  By Jung Da-min  North Korea is committed to strengthening its regional ties in Asia, especially with traditional allies such as China, Russia and Mongolia, on the 73rd anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK).  The country's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) recently published a series of articles on diplomatic and cultural events involving these countries.  This is in contrast with last year when North Korea was isolated from the international community after conducting missile and nuclear tests. In particular, North Korea-China relations had been weakened to the point where the regime's state media did not even report China's congratulatory message for the event.  On the Oct. 10 foundation anniversary this year, however, the KCNA reported that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese Embassy in North Korea sent floral baskets to the WPK Central Committee.  On Tuesday, the embassy hosted a friendly gathering attended by North Korean officials including Ri Su-yong, a member of the Political Bureau and vice-chairman of the WPK Central Committee.  According to the KCNA report, Ri watched an art performance by the Shenzen City Art Troupe together with Chinese Ambassador Li Jinjun and talked about ""the need to expand and develop bilateral relations at a new level.""  This year, North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un met Chinese President Xi Jinping in March, May and June, indicating an unwavering alliance between the countries.  On Wednesday, North Korea's party mouthpiece, the Rodong Sinmun, published a rare travel report by a North Korean journalist who visited China to trace historic sites related to North Korea-China friendly relations.  Meanwhile, North Korea is expected to boost its alliance with Russia, with Moscow confirming that President Vladimir Putin will meet Kim this year, although details have yet to be discussed. The meeting would mark the first summit between the two leaders.  In addition, North Korean media reports on exchanges with Mongolia have particularly increased, highlighting former leader Kim Il-sung's efforts to boost relations between the countries. Kim Il-sung visited Mongolia in 1956 and 1988. "

'Father's War' gets nod to resume filming ,2018-10-17 16:59,North Korea,,"By Kang Hyun-kyungDirector Lim Sung-chan got the green light from Seoul High Court for his ongoing film project, tentatively titled ""Father's War"" which revolves around the suspicious death of first lieutenant Kim Hoon two decades ago. Kim, with a gunshot wound in his temple, was found dead on Feb. 23, 1998, in an underground bunker of the Joint Security Area near the inter-Korean border. His death has since remained a mystery as investigators failed to find the murderer, paving the way for ceaseless rumors over the past two decades about the cause of his death. On Wednesday, the filmmaker got the nod from the higher court to resume filming as he intended. The higher court reversed a district court's ruling, siding with the filmmaker who claimed the lower court's decision to ban the shooting of 47 cuts violated his freedom of expression. The lower court also ordered the filmmaker or the producer to pay a 5 million won fine per day if they violate the ruling.

The lower court also ordered the filmmaker or the producer to pay a 5 million won fine per day if they violate the ruling.  The filmmaker began shooting the film starring actor Han Seok-kyu in February this year based on Kim's death. But he soon faced backlash from Kim's family. Shooting of the film has been suspended over the dispute between the filmmaker and Kim's family.Retired Lieutenant General Kim Chuk, the late Kim's father, said he rejected the filmmaker's initial request to approve his film project. Facing opposition, the filmmaker revised the scenario in vain to get his approval. The older Kim said the film defamed him and distorted the facts regarding his son's death.The older Kim challenged the filmmaker's conclusion that his son was the victim of a corruption game inside the military and faced the tragic end of his life while investigating the corruption scandal. The film indicates that the military brass was involved in the death of the younger Kim to cover up the systematic corruption inside the military. The older Kim insists his son could have been murdered by North Korean soldiers who were stationed near the Joint Security Area. Thus he said Lim's film would mislead the public if it is released. He also claimed the film defamed him by portraying him as a self-serving retired military general who abused his power to fulfill his goals. In April last year, the discontented father filed for an injunction against the filmmaker and requested the district court ban the shooting of the film. The district court ruled in favor of the Kim family. Filmmaker Lim, however, appealed to the higher court which ultimately reversed the lower court's decision. The higher court denied the older Kim's claim that the film project defamed him, noting as long as the filmmaker made notice that some elements of his film are not based on fact, the film doesn't constitute defamation. Mentioning the military's previous endeavor to reinvestigate the younger Kim's death ended in vain, the higher court said as of no_ 20 years after the incident_ is impossible to find out who murdered the younger Kim. Although the film is based on a true story, the court said, the filmmaker can dramatize what happened because this is what commercial movies usually do to entertain and attract viewers.

UN moves to adopt NK human rights resolution for 14th straight year: envoy ,2018-10-17 11:05,North Korea,,"The United Nations is expected to seek to adopt a resolution on the human rights situation in North Korea next month for the 14th straight year, diplomatic sources in New York said Tuesday. The Third Committee of the U.N. General Assembly is now drawing up a new North Korean human rights resolution, with Japan and the European Union taking the lead, the sources said, adding the document will be submitted to the committee in October. If the resolution passes the Third Committee, it will be sent to the U.N. General Assembly, which has adopted a resolution on human rights in North Korea for 13 consecutive years. With the recent progress in North Korea's relationship with the United States and South Korea, however, it remains to be seen whether there will be changes in the expression of the resolution and how strongly the North would react to it, they said. In this regard, South Korean Ambassador to the U.N. Cho Tae-yul said that the U.N. is expected to again adopt the North Korean human rights resolution this year. ""The U.N. has already adopted the North Korean human rights resolution for several years, and our mission has been deeply involved in the drawing up of the document,"" said Cho during a parliamentary audit of South Korea's mission to the U.N. in New York. Cho said that it is impossible for the two Koreas to push to connect their railways and roads and implement other cross-border economic cooperation projects without violating the U.N. sanctions on North Korea. Seoul and Pyongyang announced after high-level talks early this week that they will hold a ground-breaking ceremony in late November or early December to start the modernization and connection of railways and roads along the eastern and western regions. The agreement is a follow-up to last month's third summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Cho expressed views that the proposed inter-Korean railway and road connections, if further pushed in earnest, could be in violation of the U.N. Security Council sanctions on the North. ""Our mission has been in discussions with the U.N. and allied nations to help inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation projects proceed smoothly within the framework of the international community's North Korean sanctions,"" the ambassador said. Asked to comment on the recent demand by North Korea, China and Russia that the North sanctions be eased, Cho said sanctions relief could be considered only after Pyongyang implements any meaningful denuclearization measures.

Kaesong: gateway to Korea's past and future,2018-10-15 19:43,North Korea,," This is the second in a three-part series about travel in North Korea.  By Jon Dunbar  Road travel anywhere outside Pyongyang is extremely unpleasant. Google says the 172.3km Pyongyang-Kaesong Highway is a 102-minute trip, but the actual time is closer to two and a half hours due to the patchy roads that hinder travel speeds. Despite this, leaving the capital at least once on a visit to North Korea is worth it.  Pyongyang is a showcase city, but Kaesong better represents North Korean urban life. It served as the capital of the 918-1392 Goryeo Kingdom and still has numerous historic attractions. After division of the peninsula, Kaesong was part of the South, but changed hands during the 1950-53 Korean War.  Yet, most people in the South would only think of the Gaeseong Industrial Complex (GIC, spelled with a G to reflect the South's Revised Romanization style), located about 5km outside the populated area.  Kaesong is a beautiful and sunny, yet gritty and textured metropolis, among the North's top 10 by population with around 200,000 people. It's suffused with broad apartment buildings of many bright colors and porous back alleys offering a glimpse into real North Korean city living. Colors are stronger here than my 2010 visit, suggesting a citywide major beautification project since then.  Tongil Street cuts north-south through the city bisecting a valley, so when you enter Kaesong from the south, the road curves down and then up again to statues of former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il.   The city is a pleasing combination of medium-rise apartments and older houses, what we in the South would call hanok. But that word is foreign to North Koreans, who speak joseonmal rather than hangukmal and wear joseon-ot instead of hanbok.  Kaesong's streets are crawling with life. You can see people of all ages riding bikes everywhere, assembled together or just hanging out with no clear objective. It's different from Pyongyang where the streets feel emptier and everyone has somewhere to go. On a short bus ride through Kaesong, I witnessed people setting up stands or traveling around to sell stuff, and saw one kid offering shoe repairs.  Soon our bus pulled into a parking lot located between two mirror-opposite gift shops made in a traditional Korean style. We were at the entrance to the Kaesong Koryo Museum, which people in the South might better understand by its original name: Sungkyunkwan.  This institute of higher education, originally named Gukjagam, traces back to 992. With the changing of dynasties in the 1390s, the capital moved south to Seoul and Sungkyunkwan moved too. The Koryo Sungkyunkwan buildings remained until their destruction in the 1592-98 Imjin War. Many of the reconstructions were said to date back to 1602. Just like in the South, some of the trees were even older.  I'm one of only two members I know of an exclusive club of people who've been to all three Sungkyunkwan campuses: in Kaesong, Seoul and Suwon. After my 2010 visit, I worked for Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in Seoul, serving as the de facto English-language tour guide for the old campus.  Both Sungkyunkwan traditional campuses are identical in layout, centered around two separate rectangular yards arranged like a geomantic circuit board, one for academics and one for worship. Gukjagam was a cultural import from China's Confucianist Song Dynasty, its curriculum focused on the Confucian classics necessary for the complicated civil service exam. However, the museum, opened in 1987, highlights the prerevolutionary bad old days and emphasizes the Buddhist relics on view at this historic Confucian site.   Nevertheless, a stone plaque boasts the site was added to UNESCO's World Heritage list in Juche 102 (2013), an accomplishment still out of reach of our Sungkyunkwan.  To the west of Koryo Sungkyunkwan was a massive palatial building my guide said was Sungkyunkwan University of Light Industry. Wikimapia labels it as Koryo Sungkyunkwan Academy, and I can't guess its affiliation to the university, whose main campus is located about a kilometer south.  Yes, North Korea has its own SKKU, and it had ties with the South's during the Sunshine Era. Our SKKU claims to be the oldest in Asia, but theirs is a full four centuries older. Imagine that, if you own any SKKU paraphernalia, after reunification you might have to upgrade your ""Since 1398"" gear for ""Since 992.""  Next, we had a great lunch at a Kaesong restaurant, made possible by tour organizer Paektu Cultural Exchange. They served insam dakgom (ginseng chicken stew, indistinguishable from South Korean samgyetang), and I found actual Chinese-labeled Pepsi available. Ginseng is a staple of the region. Most of our group agreed it was our best meal so far.   As we left, I noticed a grand traditional house through the trees behind the restaurant. My guide told me it was the home of Jeong Mong-ju, a Goryeo loyalist who refused to recognize the rise of Joseon and put to death. Jeong is one of Korea's 18 Men of Virtue, and a biannual ritual at Seoul's Sungkyunkwan still honors him every year.  Kaesong's fate is to serve as a gateway between the Koreas. The city, located between Seoul and Pyongyang on Korea's oldest train line, the Gyeongui Line, has incredible cultural value. And as the site of the GIC and SKKU, it will likely serve to distribute the wealth, vocational skills and cultural savvy needed to reconnect the Korean Peninsula. In Kaesong, the inherent value in reunification for both Koreas will shine brightly.  "

Rodong calls on Europe to make 'right choice' on Russia-Germany joint project ,2018-10-15 16:50,North Korea,,"By Jung Da-minNorth Korea's party mouthpiece Rodong Sinmun's Monday edition highlighted conflicts surrounding a joint gas pipeline project between Germany and Russia, supporting Russia's argument that European countries should approve the project.In a relatively toned-down editorial titled ""Complex contradictions surrounding 'Nord Stream 2,'"" the newspaper said the American attempt to sanction countries involved in the project was aimed at replacing Russian gas with the U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Defector-turned-journalist excluded from media pool covering talks with North Korea ,2018-10-15 10:55,North Korea,,"South Korea's unification ministry has excluded a North Korean defector-turned-journalist from joining pool reporters for Monday's high-level talks with the North.Citing safety concerns and other ""special"" circumstances, the ministry earlier decided to exclude Kim Myeong-sung of the Chosun Ilbo, a local daily newspaper, from the group of reporters to be sent to the truce village of Panmunjom for the high-level talks with North Korea.Kim has worked for the country's largest-circulation newspaper for years and is currently covering the unification ministry that handles inter-Korean affairs. ""High-level talks are held in a confined space, and Kim is widely known for his active reporting. We are asking for cooperation since the decision is deemed necessary under such special circumstances, rather than trying to restrict the press,"" Baik Tae-hyun, ministry spokesman, told reporters. The spokesman added that there had been no objection from the North about the reporter and that the ministry made the decision on its own by taking into account various factors. Asked if his exclusion means defectors-turned-journalists can no longer cover inter-Korean talks, Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon told reporters before leaving for Panmunjom that he could not answer such an assumption-based question.The ministry's decision, however, is drawing strong protests from the press corps as it was made at the last moment without sufficient consultations with reporters in advance. The move is also raising eyebrows as it could be seen as an action focusing too much on how the North reacts rather than protecting freedom of the press. The press corps of the unification ministry chooses pool reporters for inter-Korean events based on predetermined orders.Monday's talks will be held on the southern side of Panmunjom inside the heavily fortified demilitarized zone that bisects the two Koreas, which technically remain at war as the 1950-53 war ended only with an armistice, not a peace treaty.About 30,000 North Korean defectors have came to South Korea so far.

'North Koreans will survive even 100 years of sanctions' ,2018-10-12 13:45,North Korea,,"North Korea's official newspaper said Friday that the country will be ready to survive even 100 years of sanctions by means of self-reliance. In a stepped-up criticism of the United States-led economic sanctions, the Rodong Sinmun, the organ of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, accused its ""enemies"" of enforcing a ""murderous"" blockade against North Korea as a last resort. But the North Koreans armed with the spirit of self-reliance and self-sufficiency will overcome the international sanctions even if they would last 10 years or 100 years, the newspaper said in an editorial. ""Our enemies are implementing a murderous blockade as a last resort after their bid to suffocate the DPRK (North Korea) by military power failed,"" the newspaper said. ""Let them stick to the sanctions for the next 10 years or a hundred years. We'll eventually overcome any sanctions and difficulties to emerge as the world's strongest power and socialist paradise. That's the determination of our people,"" the paper said. It then urged the North's people to struggle for self-reliance and economic growth and independently develop state-of-the-art technologies and facilities to incapacitate the sanctions. The editorial came after a trilateral meeting of North Korea, China and Russia recently called on the United States to ease its economic sanctions on the North in return for Pyongyang's denuclearization measures.
